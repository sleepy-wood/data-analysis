I'm a big fan of your study app as well. A suggestion (maybe it's already in there): An automatically decreasing alarm. Let's say you want to go from waking up at 8 am to waking at 7 am. It would be cool to have the app automatically go from 8 to 7 with X amount of min or sec per day.

You can press the ""Sleep"" button up to 2 hours before your bedtime goal even if your sleep duration has reached 10 hours. If you want to go to bed even earlier, just keep SleepTown open in foreground, lock the screen, and it'll automatically start a construction when your bedtime is up. This way you aren't restricted to 10 hours. :)

The permissions are for detecting if users use other apps after pressing the ""Sleep"" button, as SleepTown aims to help users maintain a regular sleep habit and keep from constantly going on their phone.
The permissions aren't necessarily required, but when they are disabled, you won't be redirected to SleepTown when exiting the app.

It motivates me to go to bed and wake up on time, using adorable little buildings in an adorable little town and daily income, which increases with every successful night's sleep (tbh in not sure what the gold is for other than building a new town). I'm a big fan. I only have minor criticisms. In the app, there is a really cool ""Buildex"" that shows all the buildings that are possible to build and reveals the ones you've completed; however, no information about the building is given other than the day you built it and how much revenue it generates. I would love to see a name for all buildings and maybe a little blurb about its function. It would make the app a lot more fun. Additionally, you can tap on some things that will bring up a small information bubble. These bubbles disappear so quickly that I'm unable to read it all with one tap, so I have to tap it 4 or 5 times to read it all. Lastly, after purchasing the premium version, I was unable to redeem my free building when I linked this account with my Forest account (I have the paid version for Forest as well). I think these three topics should be addressed, and they would really benefit the app. Overall, I'm happy I found this. Congrats on another successful productivity app!

I just have a few problems.. I start school and work at different times every day, so it's a bit difficult to have only one time to go to bed and to get up. I wish I could set the time different for every day! Also, I need to have more alarms on to wake up, so I put on a few other alarm clocks set before the time in sleep town, so when those alarms started, I couldn't go to my alarm clock app to turn them off, because then I would have to destroy my building!

phone when I go to bed. I had to uninstall when I realized there was no

in the foreground and I know it would cause this app to think I was trying 
to cheat and demolish my building when it's just an app tracking my 
movements when I sleep. I will definitely be installing this if and when 
there's a whitelist feature added, as it seems like it would be extremely 
useful to me. :) Just wanted to say I still check up on the app every so 
often to see if it's been updated with a white list because this app is a 
great concept just like Forest is and I'm really looking forward to being 
able to use it!! I know updates take time though, just wanted to express

to bed on time, the fact that you can't use it if you're late means that 
there's then no incentive to go to bed once you've missed the time. It also 
marks your building as ""failed"" if you oversleep even on weekends (although 
there is a setting that means this doesn't impact your consecutive

Sleeptown restricts your ability to leave the app (fine), but there's no

any other app for ambient noise, and that feature isn't offered in

However, you cannot switch between apps like this when using the Forest app. Not without killing your tree anyhow, as a warning comes up.

It's not required that you use it, but it makes this app so unique and special because it's like a mini workout to wake you up instead of an alarm rhat you just hit and then fall asleep again for. Puzzles on other apps don't work for me, but this does. I love getting to build a town, too, and getting rewards for continuing to use it. I bought a Play card at Walmart just so I could get premium on Forest and this. For a cost less than a meal, Sleep Town fixed my sleep schedule and Forest got me more productive. If you aren't willing to spend a dollar for all that hard work, you probably won't getuch out of it, but at least it lets you test it to make sure the sleep/wake features work on your phone. It works really well on my galaxy S4 anway. No hickups whatsoever so far.",5,4,2.0.1,2017-11-10 03:11:56,,

It basically uses the rewards of a clicker game but your rewards increase with more successful days. This app probably is getting low reviews because it's more aggressive about getting you to pay for premium before you've tried out more features. I paid for premium since I love Forest and this app has the same polish, but I understand why other users wouldn't want to pay for premium immediately.  So far I haven't encountered any bugs. The alarm clock is working fine and you can set it earlier than your wake up goal and you can change it any time. The wake and sleep goals are strict although they give you a 2 hour leeway (sleeping/waking up 2 hours earlier is ok), and you're supposed to keep it that way for a week in order to get the ticket reward. I'd recommend other users to set their wake up goal later than their actual intended wake up time just to be safe. I think it's a good feature because it forces you to be consistent with your sleep habits.",5,22,1.2.6,2017-10-22 21:05:43,,

The app told me that if I change the time then it will take away past successful nights that were outside of the new times.

I do like for example the fact that you can ask to shake your phone around like a retard to show you are awake, it really helps First of all, yes, all the fun parts are in the paid app. Secondly, the timings are a bit short, for example the other day I was a bit short on time, and went to bed at the exact bed time I set, but it was actually like 5 seconds passed that so it didn't passed, I couldn't set the alarm for the next morning, it didn't went off Furthermore, there should be some kind of whitelist, as I use like 4 alarms (sleeptown being the last one) I already forgot to set the others, realized it a few seconds after my initial bed time, so it was too late. I also once had to send an urgent text that I forgot to send at 12am, but it was 2 minutes past my bed time when I realized. So I had to get up, go downstairs and start up my PC to do so... I mean your other app can do it, so why not this one Lastly, there should be an option to set your wake up time not at a fixed time, but like X minutes after your alarm. For example today I had to get up early, so instead of my usual 8:07 I set my alarm at 6:07 , but my wake up goal time is at 8:10 (which I forgot) so the alarm went off, I woke up, tried to shut it quickly to not wake up the rest of the family, but it just wasn't late enough to disable my alarm without destroying the building. That's my experience after using it for about a week In conclusion, it's quite a nice concept, but really not well rounded , I would have put the 99 cent for the premium, like I did with forest, but this one isn't worth it. And if you tell me ""all the problems are solved in the premium app"" well then f you, at least the basic functionalities should be free",2,6,1.2.4,2017-08-26 13:33:19,,

It is unhealthy to wake up at different times every day.  The app itself does what it does but the main issue is with the free app having basically no features. Before buying things, I would like to at least test their functionality first (or at least some of it). The free version gives you basically no features aside from building a random house every night by sleeping. For me it is enough for now, but I think it might get boring really fast.

Perhaps this could even be a 'reward' option of some sort - so you can trade in coins or tickets earned in order to gain a lie-in?  My second suggestion would be louder, or different alarm sounds - the stock one with the App is far too quiet for me (I am slightly deaf!). I still set my main alarm clock on weekdays, but it would be good to have a few more options!
