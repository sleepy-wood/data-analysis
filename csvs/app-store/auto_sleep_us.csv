5,2021-10-21 00:48:36,Lizois,This is the best app that I own and that I have ever owned. I was very very sick and I finally found a Doctor Who had the maps who could figure out what was wrong. There had been a long and inexplicable problem of chronic fatigue and adverse drug reactions and no one could get a handle on it. After mountains of blood tests he entered the room and he said you’re number one problem is sleep. You think you are sleeping but actuallyYou are not getting any deep sleep. Actually this was hard to understand because I had thought my sleep was OK… So I bought an Apple Watch and the first thing I did was install this sleep app. It is one of the best things I have done in my life. I have tried other apps and this one winsAll of the medals hands-down.I have now been using it every night for three years. I still have a sleep debt. I still don’t think I have penetrated all the good things that this app can do but the degree to which it has helped my health is extraordinary. Furthermore it has shown me when my heart has gone over 180 and I didn’t feel it. I am not particularly tech savvy but this app has been so accessible and the feedback it gives me every day helps me make sense of my challenges. I secretly feel profoundly grateful to the developers. I never used to have any idea about the crucial importance the absolutely crucial importance of quality sleep and without this app I wouldn’t be able to map it. Love and gratitude to the developers.,False,Best best best ever,
5,2020-06-14 03:58:22,DMFMDJD,"Autosleep and Healthwatch are simply incredible apps and a must for anyone interested in their health. I am a physician and a bit obsessed with data. I’ve tried a dozen health tracking devices and even more apps and these two, by far, are the most insightful and well designed apps for the iPhone and Apple Watch. I’ve spent hours over the last couple months reviewing the various trends and graphical analytics these apps offer for immediate and long term feedback on my sleep hygiene and heart health. My only wish is that the developer make more apps to track other aspects of health and wellness (SpO2, perfusion index, respiratory rate, and VO2 max as the Apple Watch 6 is rumored to have these features; caloric intake and nutrition; mental health and mindfulness; maybe even goal and habit tracking). These two apps pack so much analysis into a concise and easy to read manner, I wish the other wellness aspects that I track could offer as much insight. While those would require ground-up brand new apps, one thing which could possibly be incorporated into the HeartWatch app would be the ECG data. Even though it’s only one lead, tracking QTc and PR intervals should be doable. Just a thought for future iterations. Anyway, these apps are an incredible deal and offer way more for far less than anything else I’ve found on the App Store. Keep up the good work.",False,Best Health Apps By Far,
5,2021-04-24 21:48:41,RLNfirst,"I would like to take the time to sit down and talk about this unique app. I feel sometimes putting into words how nice something is, or should I say unique is not always easy. This is for myself one of those times. I truly thank the Developer or Developers for putting out such a great unique outstanding design app that gives great sleep tracking Data. I feel really the Developers have work really hard and put a great deal of time and yes love into this app. How do you know look at the updates that are being made! The Technology for apps is changing every second every minute and yes every day. I believe the Developer is on Top of the Technology with the Software that He is coding every second and minutes of the day. I hope really after you perhaps read this you will download this and give it a try! For myself the Technology Data I get from this app is correct! But in saying that do I feel it is always right? Sometimes I think know it’s wrong, but when I really start checking I find the app and the Developers were really right after all! Well time for me to move on and face the rest of the day. So please download the app try it you will not be disappointed or sorry! ( Really ) Thanks again to the Developer really a 5 star rating unique app.",False,Unique outstanding design Sleep App!,
4,2021-10-22 11:56:14,undrinkable,"I recently switched to an Apple Watch after my Fitbit finally died, and because Apple doesn’t have a native smart alarm feature (or they do, it just doesn’t work the way I need it to), I picked AutoSleep to fill that role. I’ve been using smart alarms for years and it’s improved my sleep and wake up, so this is definitely a necessity. 

This app is A LOT. There are a lot of steps to set up everything, which is great when you need to tweak every aspect of something, but not so great when all I wanted to do was set up an alarm for a timeframe during the week. READ THE MANUAL before you purchase so you know what you’re getting into—Google AutoSleep, find their website, and read at least the parts of the manual for the features you want (the guide is huge) to figure out if this is the right app for you. I didn’t find the guide to be super clear and had to read it a couple of times, but that could be a me thing. 

Don’t miss the part where you have to set up parts in the app if you don’t want to have to turn on your alarm every single day, and make sure to turn off your watch sounds for haptics only. There’s also no pop up on the watch face to turn off the alarm, you have to go into the app and turn it off, which I really hate. Overall, none of this is a dealbreaker, but I would definitely recommend knowing what you’re getting in to first.",False,"Complicated, but wildly customizable",
5,2017-05-28 01:20:11,Happy user#1,"THIS SHOULD BE ON THE APPLE WATCH OUT OF THE BOX!!! Both apps are $5 bucks total. NOTHING when you consider the cheapest apple band is $50!! And this offers soooo much versatility for your watch. I literally would have sold this Apple Watch if it were not for these apps! They NEVER CRASH AND NEVER HAVE AN ISSUE!! also the heart watch can ALERT YOU  WHEN YOUR HEART RATE IS TOO HIGH OR TOO LOW WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT THE WATCH SHOULD DO!!! 

THE AUTO SLEEP TRACKING IS AS GOOD AND AS DETAILED AS FITBIT! For 2 bucks?!!? Come on that's a crazy deal, and the watch still has a full day battery even if you wear it to bed. I use it for voice to text alerts and emails all day at work and tracking a workout in morning with continuous heart rate tracking and still from putting it on at 10pm to track sleep , exercise at 6am, to work till 5 pm the watch still has about 20% left at 7-8pm. And if I charge it after waking from tracking sleep, for just 5 - 10 mins while I get ready in morning, brush and make coffee, it is back to 100%!! Again, Apple should be sooooo grateful that this company made these apps. I love that cardiogram is doing heart health studies with their apps and it's free, so we should all do it for the study, but THESE APPS, heart watch and auto sleep are waayy better cleaner and absolutely worth every cent.

5,2018-10-18 18:51:32,KingFlash,"I’ve had several activity trackers over the decade. They have had their strengths and weaknesses. Up until now, the Jawbone UP3 was the best for sleep tracking. My Garmin Vivoactive HR was great for activity, but terrible for monitoring sleep. I finally gave in to the Apple Watch series 4, and love it, but am still surprised that they don’t outright offer sleep tracking. I have a varied schedule and work nights, so knowing how behind or on track with sleep is very difficult. I skeptically bought the AutoSleep triad of apps and have been amazed at their accuracy. The auto sleep detect has been right on. And I am impressed with the ability to distinguish deep sleep. I can tell when that is accurate as well... I’ve felt tired after 7 hours of sleep and the app shows I got no deep sleep. Conversely, I’ll make up for it with 6 or 7 hours of sleep and have 3 hours of deep sleep and I feel great. So I know it’s accurate. The breakdown of my averages of sleep and heart rate are very useful as well. It’s not perfect. I’ve taken naps in the late afternoon that it has missed. But overall, the accuracy is stunning.

This is money extremely well-spent. It adds so much value to my Apple Watch for me. I can’t believe Apple has ignored this aspect of its health applications. But AutoSleep is about as good as it gets.",False,Rather outstanding,

The process has been long, and I've had to implement a lot of different things to support my sleep but AutoSleep has shown what works and what doesn't, it's helped me figure out the ideal time to wind down, it's shown me how alcohol impacts my heart rate and robs me of deep sleep, it's confirmed that my breathing patterns are problematic, it's shown how effective taking valerian root has been for me but how ineffective taking melatonin has been for me (you may have a different experience!) I could go on...  It has provided a ton of helpful data and with that data I've experimented and have gone from averaging 4/5 hours of sleep to averaging 6/7 hours of sleep. I chose this app over other apps because of the one time fee and I love that you don't have to do anything except fall asleep with your watch on for it to start tracking.
The only thing I haven't figured out is how to track my occasional 15/20 minute power naps. The app seems to only kick in if you've slept for over 30

5,2022-06-22 15:52:30,Dude0u812,"After Jawbone shut down their servers I had to scramble for a sleep tracker. Decided on Apple Watch, and then Pillow as the engine. It worked great for a couple years or so and thought it was as good as I could get from Apple Watch. 

But then, discovered AutoSleep. And for under $10 I got an entire package of apps that I “own” without the subscription monkey on my back. I still use Pillow (unsubscribed) for an alternate opinion on my sleep, but AutoSleep has become my favorite. So many better graphs and insights, and the included (in the package) Heart insights make this a great deal that no Apple Watch user should be without. In one glance I can see a visually clear picture of the stages of sleep, quantity of the stages, and I have the ability to drill down as need be. Only bummer is I have to trigger Apple’s “sleep” mode in order to capture respiratory data (grrr, Apple!!). Other than that, everything is indeed automatic.

Great deal, and I hope this app serves as an example of how excellent programming and design combined with a fair price out the door can eliminate “subscriptions” as a pricing model, especially when there is little outside data or server space involved.

I spent a solid chunk of time researching sleep apps and settled on AutoSleep. BY FAR the best app right now! I’ve converted a number of people from Sleep Cycle and other various apps and they all love this one more. The ability to have it automatically determine when you’re sleeping is massive! It makes it VERY user friendly. The only thing I had to adjust to was charging my Apple Watch an hour before bed and then wearing it while I sleep, as I used to let it charge overnight. However, I’m super happy I made this small change because legitimately my sleep hygiene has improved along with my quality. The only hiccup I’ve ran into is to make sure my iPhone is NOT on the bed, as I have the setting turned on for it to think if I’m using the phone then I am awake. I thought this would mean actively using it (phone unlocked and screen on), but apparently it uses the sensors for movement as well. Not a big deal, though it’d be nice to have the option to turn that off (sometimes I fall asleep reading on my phone). 5/5 stars and highly recommend the app!

5,2020-12-03 10:53:34,Scdepatr,"There are few apps that I use every single day, but this is definitely one of them. Sleep is so important to the body and I really like seeing how I’m doing in that area. Checking my deep sleep, my total sleep, my heart rate and all of the other valuable information in this app is some thing I do each morning after I get up. On a few occasions I have gone to bed without my watch I really miss getting that level of detail about my sleep session. 

There is one thing I would love to see added to the app and that is a cat nap or a power nap feature. Maybe that would be added to auto awake and not auto sleep ... I’m not sure. I used to use a Jawbone before I got my Apple Watch and I loved that I had a power nap feature where I could push a button saying that I was going to lay down and go to sleep and then it would know when I fell asleep and wake me up 20 minutes later or 30 minutes later or whatever was in my settings. I miss being able to have some thing to track how long I’ve been asleep and then wake me up in a certain amount of time.

 If one of these two apps could do that ...it would be the perfect addition!",False,I check it every day!,
4,2021-10-11 17:41:33,Chappy024,"So I really like this app and have been using it for a few years now, but one thing that really bothers me is that you are limited on when the day turns over and your sleep will start counting towards the next day. When changing that setting you can only choose from 5 pm to midnight. As someone who does shift work, I would love to set my day to change over at noon, as I usually sleep in the afternoon. So if my “new day” starts at 5 and I go to sleep at 3, then I end up with my sleep split between yesterday and today, which makes it difficult to track properly. And I could set the day to start at midnight, but on my days off when I “sleep in” I usually wake up after midnight and then I encounter the same problem. 

Also the app seems to have difficulty figuring out what to do with your rings if you wake up for a couple hours and then take a nap. Which I understand is less than ideal sleep and isn’t a problem that most people have but it happens to me often enough to warrant mentioning. 

At the very least if they could change it so I can choose any time during the day to start tracking my sleep (like how it was years ago) I would gladly change the rating to 5 stars. Aside from that one real gripe, the app is awesome",False,Less useful for shift workers,
2,2021-02-05 21:18:11,Seven_Of_Nine_2350,"It’s a good app, but it drains my battery. I go to bed with 90 or 100% battery and wake up with 40%. They do have a supposed fix in the faq, but it’s not complete and only seemed to work for a short time. They tell you to delete the watch app, restart the watch and phone, and reinstall. But first of all, you can’t actually delete the app without unpairing the watch first. I made this mistake and clicked where it said “remove from phone screen” or something like that, only to discover that the app had disappeared but not actually deleted. It was a bit of a challenge at that point to find out how to actually delete it, and after a significant amount of searching I found how to get to it and that you can’t delete the app without unpairing the watch. 
So after going through all that, unpairing the watch, deleting and restarting everything, it seemed like the problem temporarily got better for a week or two, but has now resorted to draining the battery again. I have another sleep app that doesn’t do this, so I don’t understand what the problem with this one is. I only wanted this one as a comparison with the other one, and it does have some additional features, but this battery draining is just not worth it. Also unpairing, deleting, reinstalling and restarting every two weeks is also not worth it.",False,"Nice, but kills battery",
5,2022-08-19 15:54:19,Denise53M,"Love this app. I used to track my sleep on my Fitbit, but it didn’t give me enough details. Once I bought my Apple watch, I was interested in digging deeper into my sleep health. It was great, but once I downloaded the app, it has been a game changer! And by the way, this app is much less expensive than others. 

I have had sleeping issues for years. I have no problem falling asleep, but I wake up and my mind starts racing, from one thought to the next. Sometimes my thoughts are about things I need to do, or I replay a scenario in my head and what I should have said or done. Other nights, I feel like they’re someone else’s thoughts because they make no sense. 

I always blamed it on my fast paced, stressful and demanding job. However, now that I’m retired, that doesn’t apply. This app measures everything my body goes through during the night, when I’m sleeping. I especially like the sleep bank - shows how much sleep you’ve recorded, and whether you have accumulated more sleep than you need or if you have a sleep debt. I always have a sleep debt and app the app details exactly how you can reduce it. A big thanks to the developers!! Outstanding technology!!",False,Best Sleep App Ever!,

It has the visual niceties like reusing the rings concept that Apple Health uses, and is attractive and pleasant to use. I'm happy with the number and presentation of the graphs. In terms of accuracy, I can't second guess what it says about light vs deep sleep, but it gives me confidence that the asleep/awake determination is surprisingly accurate. Importantly, when it is mistaken, there are ways provided to correct it--including one that doesn't just override the data but is meant to calibrate it for future accuracy. Maybe the only thing I don't like is the relationship to AutoWake and HeartWatch which seem to be companion apps. It's slightly confusing (though ultimately convenient) that these are accessible via the app. Since the app uses wake data and heart rate data, I wasn't sure (and I guess am still not sure) whether they were dependencies that needed to be configured for the sleep tracking to work optimally or merely companion apps that present another lens through which to view some of the data AutoSleep uses.",False,"Does everything I need, and does it well",

However, it showed significant inconsistencies recording deep sleep and HRV (heart rate variability) which count towards the readiness index. This index was almost always opposite to what the other submetrics were showing (almost every time I was on red with sleep quality, deep sleep, heart dips etc., the readiness index was on green or close to rather than the other way around). After going through their FAQs which seemed to support the fact that errors have been reported about these issues, I made sure to reach out to their customer service as a sign of respect for their product. I followed their guidance to lower my deep sleep setting (even though it contradicted their HRV indicator of the past few nights - I use Breathe in the morning to accurately report that metric) and it still didn’t read it. Meanwhile, the metrics on two other apps (SleepWatch and Sleep Cycle) yielded similar metrics compared to AutoSleep. When I emailed the AutoSleep customer service and requested a refund out of concern that the app was not running well, their response was that the app works and that it is designed for “tech savvy” customers. Not only was that condescending but highly inaccurate in my case. Maybe it works for others but, in my case, I’m choosing to go with other apps at this point.",False,Think twice about it!

If you don’t have a watch, the app correlates the data from when you plug your phone in vs unplugging it, but it also takes into effect when your phones screen is on and subtracts it from your total sleep hours! This is the first app I’ve ever seen do this!

When you use it with your watch, if you turn it into “Theater Mode”, it gets really detailed information about your sleep and tells you when you were in different sleep levels, but with Theater mode all night it uses a whopping 2% battery. It still correlates phone screen time into sleep totals, and subtracts that from your sleep, so you get a much more accurate picture of how long and well you’ve slept. The only bad thing is you have to remember to charge the watch before you get to the point of being in bed.

With this app I discovered that I really should not have any alcohol 3-4hrs before going to bed otherwise my body wastes more energy processing the alcohol through my system than helping my body recover while I sleep and I don’t wake up feeling rested.

I’m wearing my watch every night, I’m the correct position. I’m putting my phone on my bedside table and not moving it. I’m doing the lights off thing. It just doesn’t work. It’s also pretty annoying that every night I have to set the alarm to remind myself to charge my watch a bit before bed. It’s like that alarm just…disappears  every day. I paid $4 for this app, and I want my money back. The Health app tracks my sleep better than this app tbh. Not to mention the app is very confusing to use, I had to watch the tips and into like 3 times to figure it out when I first downloaded the app. The only good thing about this app is the wake up alarm (which I can’t set on an automatic schedule either. I have to set it every night I want to wake up with it). It’s nice waking up to a soft nudge, but that’s about it.

At first it seems a little intimidating with all the information, but you get use to it pretty quickly. In order to record you sleep accurately you must make sure your phone is not on the bed with you and that you adjust your sleep/wake calibration in setting. You may need to set it a couple of times before it accurately records your sleep. When you first get the app, the around the first week or so when you get up look at the app and see if you agree with the amount of sleep you got. Some is of move more the others while we sleep and that is what sleep/wake calibration is for. Go to settings on bottom right and scroll down until you see sleep/wake calibration and use the setting the best represents what you think you really slept.

Otherwise the next day   am reproved by messages from the app and encouraged to go to bed at an unrealistic time. There are a few odd problems. The app sometimes decides that I have woken a half-hour or more before I think I’ve woken up. Occasionally the app will decide that I’m sleeping when I’m actually playing a game on my phone or browsing social media. Nevertheless, the app errs on the side of finding that I’m awake.

A quick 15-20 minute recharge once or twice a day keeps me going all night. The app does the rest. No more hiding my phone under a pillow or forgetting to turn on the sleep tracking app (only for them to crash). This app doesn't run all night long. Instead it uses the brilliant approach of analyzing the data already collected on the iPhone and Apple Watch. It takes that data and draws logical conclusions about when you were asleep. I don't write reviews very often, and I don't write them unless I've been using the app for a while. I have been suing this one for about 10 months now, and it does a great job at determining my sleep time. To make matters even better, the deveeloper is constantly updating the app to make it better.

I especially love that it contains so much in-depth information, and easily accessible graphic historical sleep values. It works best in conjunction with the sister HeartWatch app, which allows someone who is extremely health conscious to dig deeper into the details. Perhaps some users want an app to summarize everything for them. AutoSleep and HeartWatch do that, but also allow you to view the actual data. I don’t just want my “average” heart rate, I want to see all of the readings used to calculate that average. I want the details, and these apps make them available.
The one weakness for me, and not a major issue, is the “Wellness” calculation apparently based on one Apple Watch HRV reading. This is perhaps more of an issue with Apple Watch, as the HRV readings I get from my Watch don’t correlate to the detailed readings I get from a dedicated HRV device I use.

My favorite thing is the readiness score. I have a tendency to either sleep very little or a lot and have trouble finding a system that makes me feel prepared for the day. I’ll sometimes think I’ve slept a ton and still feel terrible or think I didn’t sleep at all and feel great but the app tracks the quality of my sleep in a way that actually gives me a accurate idea of how I’ll feel and how productive I’ll be through the day. I usually plan sleep around that score rather than just having the time to sleep.

Occasionally the app will think I’ve fallen asleep late at night if I’m watching TV and barely moving, but the editing capabilities for the previous night’s sleep is first rate and you can quickly make adjustments. It also has a sensitivity setting that you can adjust to take into account how much you naturally move at night so it will track sleep more accurately.

The “Readiness” rating seems to be the most arbitrary of all the data the app produces. I gave it two weeks before rating but things haven’t really improved.

UPDATE: Still experiencing issues with data accuracy. The application has a Sleep/Wake Consistency feature that will track your sleep and wake times, however you cannot set your sleep time past 12am midnight.

On the positive side, I can clearly see how my best days are preceded by a good night’s sleep. It’s motivating me to really work on changing my sleep habits. 

This wouldn’t be possible if I couldn’t rely on the software to give me credible data. After the first few days of tweaking the readings (an easy process), I now get sleep records I trust, whether the sleep was good or bad.

Going to bed wearing a sufficiently charged watch is sometimes challenging, and I find myself wanting to stay up too late so I can charge it to see how well I sleep. Silly of me.

I too often go 24 hours without sleep, sleep for 12 hours at a time, or lie in bed for hours trying to fall asleep.

This app hasn't missed the mark once. I ran the setup wizard on day one and set the app to interpret phone motion as me being awake. I wear my watch to bed and leave my phone charging on my night stand. This combination hasn't messed up once. Every sleep, every nap, every hour lying awake, all counted correctly. The data is presented in various interesting and useful ways. I knew my sleep habits were horrible, but there is just something about seeing them displayed graphically that makes me more inspired to actually fix them. 

As if that wasn't enough, I contacted support for what I thought was a glitch, and I received an email the same day that solved the problem on the first try. I had accidentally excluded one day's data from the history, so there was no problem with the app in the first place.

My only concern with wearing my watch to bed was battery life, since I also want to wear it while awake. This hasn't been an issue. It charges so quickly that it has been enough to simply charge it here and there when I'm in the shower, eating, etc.

Not only does it have an immense amount of reporting for each night’s sleep (including an overlay of the heart rate and the sleep in various depths), averages over time, assessments of how quality the sleep was, a smart alarm to wake you when you’re in light sleep, and an estimated sleep debt/credit, it’s also SLICK. The user interface glides in really user appealing ways. Bravo.

The one thing I wish for on top of all of this is for complications on the watch - I can make shortcuts, but it would be neat to have a complication for lights off, or for the sleep app in general. Though I do appreciate that the shortcut for lights off and “how did I sleep?” are quick options inside the app!

Regardless, I’m beyond happy to have paid for this app, and that there is a Watch app to go with it, too.

It’s given me perspective on the impact of booze, too. I don’t know if I’m uniquely sensitive to it, but if I have more than 2 or 3 drinks, my sleep stats really suffer. My heart rate jumps 20% to 40% above my no-booze norm and I don’t get any deep sleep. I had always known that alcohol can negatively impact sleep, but seeing is believing. I just don’t grab those extra drinks at night anymore ... because if I don’t get that deep sleep ... I just feel sad.

Within a few days, I had enough data using the sleep app to see what was going on. I was in massive sleep “debt”, and my heart was being impacted. For the little sleep I was getting, the app helped to show it was poor quality and almost no deep sleep. Without quality, deep sleep my entire body was in overdrive and that included my heart. The heart app showed similar trends of significantly high heart rate.

Results - Once I started to follow the sleep guidance, my heart immediately followed suit. I was getting more quality sleep, and my heart was able to rest. It’s been 1 week, since then I’ve dropped my caffeine intake dramatically. I drink for choice not energy. I start my day off at 6am versus I was a 8-10am riser, and I always wake up feeling more rested.

When I have contacted support, I have found that the tone of the emails tends to be rather snarky and condescending, and quite frankly, that is not cool.   Although the tech specialists have tried to blame the issues on my watch not capturing the data, I find it a bit odd that, if I delete the app from my phone entirely and then reinstall it, the data magically appears (which would seem to suggest that the watch has captured something in spite of what I am being told).

I thought I awoke more than it said, but I didn’t move, so I don’t know how it could have known my eyes were open.

This provides the most intuitive way of seeing in a general how the sleep pattern (stages) is changing dat-to-day.

I've been using Autosleep for give or take a year. I've had only success tracking my sleep quality with this app. Recently, I was switched to working night shift at work and noticed in the setup wizard that there was no option to set bedtime when I usually went to sleep. Naturally, I sent an email to their support team. 

This is where I became more impressed. I received a response from David the same day before I went to work. He let me know that the app is able to determine when you sleep regardless if you set your actual bedtime. The auto detection figures it all out itself. Honestly, I'm very impressed with the ease of use with this app. You really only need to install it and it takes over completely without any user input.

There's a ton of information presented and it will overwhelm you at first. And it will continue to overwhelm you. You will need to devote time to understanding the display of data and the myriad options available. But if you stick with it, you'll appreciate what it has to offer.

I wish the designer could better arrange the data for different levels of data density rather than throwing everything on screen at once. Like, present a VERY basic top level that's easy to understand, then allow us to drill down for detail. It could really benefit from a 3rd party audit on data presentation.

That said, I was able to muddle through understanding the screens after careful study and really enjoy the ability to look at my sleep data and trends in various ways.

Example: last night, I fell asleep at 2 and woke up at 10. AutoSleep thinks I was only asleep until 8. So, I go in to tell the app how long I was actually asleep, and the closest I can get is midnight to 10. That’s frustrating. It either looks like I slept way more or way less than I did. 

I’d like it if the app allowed you to manually set when you feel like you were asleep instead of auto-generating a dozen tiles that are more likely to be wrong. That way, the data would be more likely to be correct.

The app has also incorrectly identified me as being asleep during the day while I’m sitting in class awake, and as far as I’ve been able to tell, there’s no feature to let me cut that half hour I was supposedly asleep during out of my data.

I was looking for a sleep tracking app because after I got covid, my energy was never quite the same. I used to function on only a 5 hours of sleep, and after the fact, I could not find energy to do much throughout the day.  I would take 2-3 naps and I just couldn’t function properly at work.

Surprisingly, this app helped change my habits almost instantly. I wanted to turn all the rings green and I started getting 8-9 hours. I saw what was affecting my sleep quality — when I had a night that wasn’t great, I was able to think back to what I did the day before — eating too late, not exercising, drinking, etc.

So much better than any subscription because I wasn’t going to pay for that, not knowing if I’d like it.

“So you don’t care about whether your Watch synchs health data? That’s a pretty major feature! This is kind of strange. Anyway, your choice. The refund is via Apple explain to them your Watch is faulty and does synch health data properly and they should issue a refund.”

Although it’s so helpful and downright practical, it does have a hiccup or two that might need tweaking.

At times it seems to have trouble “catching” when I go to sleep. Still am not sure whether it’s better to just fall asleep or set the ap when I’m ready to sleep. Any suggestions?

Also—I’m 75—if I want to “hit the hay” before 9pm I think it gets confused; or, for example, just ignores the fact that I probably went to sleep before 9 and thus it will just call it day (or night!) and “choose” a later time that I “fell asleep”.

Regardless—I still relish this ap greatly—thanks for what it does!

5,2021-05-31 21:25:52,artwire,"I got my watch series 6 one month ago and I was skeptical about whether or not it would motivate me to change my habits. After a year of hibernation, I knew I needed to do something. I think it has made a real difference. One major positive development is I’m now tracking my sleep with this app. I have tried a few others but this interface seems to be the most comprehensive, while still being easy to use. It’s certainly priced reasonably and offers a lot for the money. I’ve run into just a few issues — primarily when it thinks I’m sleeping while reading or watching tv. My heart rate drops and the app immediately starts recording sleep.  Sometimes the calibration options don’t reflect actual sleep time, so I’ve had to edit the timeline. often I can get a more accurate read by comparing the night’s results to those recorded ( or should I say interpreted differently) by other sleep tracking apps that are accessing the same watch data.  The least successful aspect for me has been the “readiness” rating… but that’s not a major concern since I have doubts the watch reading for V02 is accurate, anyway. I know I have become a very restless sleeper lately, despite a new mattress and some other remedies, and I think the app occasionally thinks I’m awake when I’m just thrashing around. It would be great if there were a way to adjust it for personal sleep volatility. All that notwithstanding, for the most part I’ve enjoyed using it and I think it has made me more aware of changes I need to make in every day behavior. Going to sleep earlier, for example, really has improved my sleep quality and deep sleep numbers. Who knew?  Looking forward to additional future improvements as the watch software is updated  — the developers have done an excellent job and I’m really impressed with their attention to detail.

5,2020-04-08 02:45:54,Ghost Moleucule,"I have always had a great difficulty when it comes to sleep, as I have had insomnia for most of my entire life. This app, being free especially, is amazing, and it contains SO much awesome, helpful, accurate and specific info and data, which is fascinating to look at too! It’s great, I’ve managed to adjust my sleep cycles based on what data comes from the last night of sleep I’ve just had, and because it allows one to look back through the history of ANY day’s data, it feels almost like a biofeedback device but one that can do so much more than just track breathing. It’s very interesting to check all the stats of a particular sleep session, and I’ve found many answers as to why I have the specific issues I have, when I try to or am asleep. I think it’s great AutoSleep even includes the decibel level throughout the entire course of the sleep cycle. I honestly have downloaded and tried SO MANY different health apps, but this one is the only one I truly can say I LOVE and actually use, let alone ENJOY using! 

I agree though, that this app and the features it contains should be a built-in out-of-the-box feature for Apple Watch, and one thing I wouldn’t mind would be for the developers to maybe further flesh out the iPhone version of the app. I hate when my watch is either already dead or dies during my sleep, so I lose all data in full for that night. I wish it could do some sort of “Handoff” between both devices to also more accurately gather data, although I don’t have any actual complaints about these things in the first place; just helpful suggestions. 

A must-have especially for people with sleep diaorders, IMO! Also great for people who want to boost their waking life’s productivity and functionality by ensuring ways to train oneself for better and better quality sleep as a whole! I would recommend this app to friends and family, for sure.",False,Truly one of the best apps I’ve tried & used in AGES.,

Have been using for a while now. Not a lot of flashy content like narrated bedtime stories or guided mediations, but its a well made app and provides all the features you need for a high quality sleep tracker especially if you have the apple watch. The stats are very helpfully presented so it’s much easier to quickly understand how you slept and you can program Siri Shortcuts or Apple Health to do whatever you want with that information so you’re not limited by the app interface if that’s important to you. I like to have Siri read me my sleep stats after the weather every morning immediately after my alarm goes off. You can customise basically everything which is good. Sometimes it seems to record sleep when I am watching tv, and I wish it had a quicker way to remove these windows. There is a setting where I could prevent this by only having it measure during the nighttime hours but I like having it on all the time because I am a frequent napper and I don’t want my readiness statistic to be skewed if I sleep in or go to bed early and it gets cut off by that for some reason. The daily statistics are quite motivating. I quite like checking my daily readiness score especially.

5,2018-11-18 18:04:51,slowkoni,"Definitely much better than SleepWatch. I’ve tried many apps and sleep analyzing smart devices like S+, jawbone up (like Fitbit), apps that use either the microphone or the motion sensor in the phone (placed on your mattress by your head), to track, analyze, and improve sleep quality and consistency. None of them come anywhere close to as good as this app combined with wearing your Apple Watch to bed and using the “lights out” button on the Watch app to tell it you are now turning out the light and attempting to begin sleeping. It can still work without the watch using the phone motion sensor, but I can’t speak to how well that works. Even better, if you have already been wearing your watch to bed regularly, as soon as you install the app you can review the past 7 days of sleep from data the watch already routinely collected while sleeping. It seems accuracy improves going forward though, possibly because this app causes the watch to collect data more frequently throughout the night. I recommend also you fine tune how still or restless (move a lot while asleep) a sleeper you are, such that if you remember getting up or waking up in the middle of the night, that these waking events are detected at the times you recall them occurring. Other waking events may be detected by the app which you do not remember, but that is ok and expected - part of the purpose of using this app regularly is to track and identify awakenings throughout the night which you do not remember.",False,"Best Sleep tracking/analyzing app, with Apple Watch",

4,2021-01-17 13:19:13,ChazwickB,"Love AutoSleep, and have been a mostly loyal user since 2017. The design of the app has always been great, and the insight it provides based on multiple metrics like sound, movement, heart rate are incredibly useful to get an overall picture of how you’re sleeping and how your sleep could impact your overall health. Most importantly is it allows you to spot patterns over time. If you Understand the data provided, check out the Explore feature, which really lets you get down with your data by comparing any two of multiple possible metrics. 

My only problem with AutoSleep is that it still lacks proper Shortcuts support. It supports Siri Shortcuts but as I’ve requested a couple of times now, it needs proper Shortcuts actions to let users retrieve data. You can have the current actions optionally copy the data to clipboard as a dictionary. This is okay, better than nothing, but really is overdue for an update here. It would be much more useful to just have one Shortcuts action that lets you select which metric you want to retrieve and what date or date range you want to get it for and then returns as some kind of object similar to Health samples in Shortcuts. It’s not hard to process the dictionary data currently, but it’s definitely unnecessary and made worse by the need for multiple actions if you want all the useful data. 

Don’t let this dissuade you. AutoSleep is still the best sleep tracking app on the market. Hands down. There’s some who come close but this is it.",False,"Automatic, beautiful, insightful, lacks proper Shortcuts support",

5,2021-10-31 13:59:19,Chesnut12344,"So I didn’t plan to come back and write a review for an app I’ve had for a year. I bought this on the fly in 2020 and this app has brought me so much joy in the amount of information that it gives and how it displays.
I bought this app after a year of inconsistent sleep. 2020 hit everyone like a bomb and it especially hit my emotional health hard. Anxiety and depression that I dealt with in high school resurfaced and I was suddenly having a terrible sleep pattern. I was up late one night and decided to download this app to defeat my lack of sleep once and for all.
When I first downloaded the app, there was definitely a learning curve but the first thing I noticed was NO SUBSCRIPTIONS. That’s incredibly rare to ask for these days apparently. Secondly, if there was ever a human version of “plug and play” this is it. It took maybe 30 minutes to set up my iPhone and Apple Watch with the right notifications, health app data, etc. and…. I did what most people do and forget you bought an app and never use it.
When I went for my next doctors appointment two months later to talk about my sleep problem, I remembered about this app and opened it. Low and behold AutoSleep had been accurately tracking my sleep. Deep sleep, sleep time, heart rate while sleeping, everything my doctor needed to realize how big of an issue it was. It’s one thing to tell your doctor you have trouble sleeping but it’s something else to have exact times and numbers to discuss with you doctor.
Now every time before I go to the doctor or notice a problem in my sleep, I’ll open this app to see what’s up: did my new sheets make me sleep less? Did the night light I install keep me out of deep sleep? Did my new work assignment cause me more anxiety and do I need a dosage increase on my anxiety meds?
This app has changed my view on sleep. So why have I waited until now to write this review? THE SMART ALARM. For the past week I have been using the smart alarm because I’ve noticed I wake up groggy often with my regular alarms. Smart Alarm gradually wakes you up over time waking you out of deep sleep, getting your body into “light sleep” and then going full force in trying to wake you up. I had tested it before while awake and thought the vibration options were pretty light and wouldn’t wake me up… I was WRONG. This week I’ve been waking up to what is more natural for my body with the smart alarm and I have eliminated that grogginess I was talking about. I woke up refreshed every day the alarm was used and felt ready to tackle on the day. 
I have zero complaints. Maybe there is a mini learning curve to using the app and it only gives the most accurate data with an apple watch. This app also doesn’t really do anything else other that track sleep. This app works well for anyone who just wants to set the app and forget about it until you need to see the sleep data. It’s non-invasive and not focused on positivity or anything fake. Just the cold hard data that you need to make decisions on your own health.",False,A Year Later,"{'id': 26022200, 'body': 'What an amazing review, we really appreciate you taking the time and sharing your experience. Wishing you all the best in your sleep and health!', 'modified': '2021-11-01T23:37:21Z'}"
2,2022-02-19 05:04:34,jpcdeux,"Tries WAY too hard and the result is a messy, unintuitive clustered UI",False,Over complicated,
2,2022-02-07 11:53:47,Sbrowhmdaov,So complicated I’m not sure what to do with the info.,False,So Complicated,
5,2021-10-02 23:30:55,camira2,"No doubt this team is trying to get it right with each iteration. If you value your sleep and are looking for the best way to leverage your Apple Watch investment, this is it. Does an outstanding job of helping to correlate several metrics that then give you a window into your sleep patterns. 

The above said, after using the app for quite a long time, there are several suggestions that would make it absolutely phenomenal. 

1. I still don’t understand why the separate “clock” tab is needed. It’s actually a bit confusing as to why it’s even there. Let me dive into the details I want right from the “Today” tab. 
2. Great data but little insight provided to sleep disorders such as sleep apnea, etc. Anyone using this is trying to get to the “why?” and “how do I correct it?”  There are ring versions of this that doctors use and charge a fortune for. Would happily pay a monthly fee to have my collected information analyzed by either a sleep expert or an ever-evolving AI. 
3. In addition to #2, more info on what “normal” sleeping patterns should look like would be great. Helps us know when a call to an actual Dr might be in order. 
3. The Detailed “Sleep Session” (two clicks off the Main tab) is my go to. Really well done. That said, once you get so far into the day, the detailed screen disappears. Furthermore, when you go to history you never get see that awesome screen again! If the idea is to change elements that might lead to better sleep and use historical data as a baseline for progress, it’s just not there. Give me the detail screen on any historical day I choose, please!
4. Staying on the History tab, the key aspects of sleep defined in in the Main tab change. It’s almost like a different program and I don’t quite understand why. Zzz? How do I rationalize that to the current day’a data? It’s not horrible, but could be overhauled for much better alignment to the rest of the program. Oh, and moving back through your history is amazingly cumbersome - almost frustrating.

I am not a serious athlete, but rather a 60 year old guy doing my best to stay healthy and get healthier and with the release of the Series 6, my interest was drawn in a more serious way. 

Tracking my sleep is VERY important. It is the best indicator for me to tell me how my day is going to go. I’m very “tuned in to” my body and quality sleep is s as important as length.

Researching all the apps out there, Auto Sleep kept consistently coming out as one of the top two or three out there and was touted for its ease of use. And the fact that it AUTOMATICALLY detects your sleep so that accidentally missing nights doesn’t happen is the big seller (unless you forget to wear it or run out of charge). The Series 6 charges so quickly, that this has not been an issue for me. I put the watch on the charger as I’m winding down for the evening and that has worked out great. 

There is more info/data than I know what to do with and there is a learning curve, especially if you get the whole suite of apps, which I did. I’m still trying to figure it all out. But more is better in this case. 

I made the jump to Apple Watch on the hope that AutoSleep was going to be the difference between making an expensive mistake, or loving the Apple Watch, now being able to take advantage of all the other great integrated features between it and my iPhone and my health tracking. 

Verdict... I love my new Apple Watch. Thank you AutoSleep!",False,Lives up to the hype!,

5,2021-01-19 13:03:58,TheDarrow,"I’ve tried them a all and this one surpasses all the others by far. I’ll mention a few specific details but mostly it is the fact that all these details end up making this sleep/health app so easy to use and understand that using it actually makes a significant difference in my life. 

* Automatic analysis works - I am a very complicated sleeper... some Apps can’t deal with anyone who doesn’t fit that 8+ hours once a day mold. This one easily keeps track of different/multiple sleep sessions and even manages to intelligently delineate which sessions should go with which calendar day, when that’s not so obvious because they are many and not at regular intervals. Very impressive. And I don’t have to do hardly anything for all that to work. I put my watch on and try to remember to hit the bedtime icon to give it a little extra help but really, I just have to wear my watch for those extra little naps. That’s it! 

* The data is easy to read at a glance. There is so much of it that to take even moderately full advantage of that I did have to actually read the help pages but A) only to go deeper (I get the general idea even without that ) and B) those help pages are easy to access and illustrative, so it is easy to quickly get to that next level of understanding. 

* There are so many views on the data (and the UI for that data is so good [simple things like the instinctual color choices other apps manage to screw up]) I find myself really testing out things, getting new insights, etc. 

I short, I used to just go by the clock for ”how much sleep” I’ve had in a day but no longer... I look to this app to see if I should try to get more sleep or I’d it is ok to push myself on a project, etc, and I feel much better and sharper for it.   

It has also been very validating... my best sleep (the most-and-longest dips into light purple rather than just light sleep) is always in late mornings... 8-9am to 11-12am... you know, the exact tone the rest of the world wants you to get up or else assumes you’re lazy. Screw that! Now I have the data... that wrecks me because I don’t get as good sleep at other times, no matter how I regulate my “sleep hygiene habits”. I’m just not built like that. I’m built like I’m built. Only now I have proof. This makes sense... some of us should be built to watch for attacking lions at night then sleep when the rest of you are safely awake again! The real lesson in the early bird story is that the worm should sleep in if the worm is meant to sleep in, then it won’t get eaten by the early bird because it’s too groggy to make smart decisions!",False,This App Is Simply THE BEST!,

5,2020-07-04 18:16:38,Giann!,"I was a Fitbit user for several years, enjoyed that tracker with heart rate monitoring and sleep tracking. Held off on an Apple watch because of lack of sleep tracking.  I ended up trying the Apple watch and because it has so much more functionality than the Fitbit I was begrudgingly OK losing the sleep tracking functionality.  

I also expected iOS was going to be updated to include sleep tracking and after seeing videos showing how basic that sleep tracking would be, I decided to try this app.  One of the reasons I gave this app a try was that I’d rather pay a few bucks and have better privacy policies which this app developer addressed.  What I didn’t quite expect was how much better this app is than my beloved Fitbit sleep tracking capabilities. There is a lot of data and after using this app I can tell you the accuracy of the sleep times is quite good.  I do wake up once or twice an evening and those times are reflected accurately.  There is a good amount of information beyond just those times as well. 

One feature I like is “Lights Out”.  You manually let the app know when you turn off the TV, lights, etc and you intend to fall asleep.  This sets a marker at that time and you can see the next morning how long it took you to fall asleep.  Cool. 

There are a handful of notifications including when to charge your watch in the evening to ensure you can make it through the night, when to wind down for bed, next morning you get a notification with sleep stats, etc. 

You can set your sleep goals, other customizations both in terms of sleep data and cosmetically for the app itself.  Highly recommend, if you’re on the fence just do it. You will not be disappointed.",False,Autosleep vs Fitbit and iOS 14 sleep tracking,

For instance my deep sleep shower always 0 or very low but I tweaked a setting and now I show 4 hours deep sleep. There is an option to +or- a setting and one press server to give me totally different readings. I am not a fan of the circular display of results and think this could be displayed to be less complicated.  Even lights off option has issues. Again if the wide range of options and variables could be cut down and simplified, it would be beneficial. I previously used a Fitbit and thought it to be more beneficial and accurate. I know an I watch should be much more accurate and powerful than a Fitbit but not with this app. If I had a more accurate and less complicated sleep app, it would be so much more $ than I paid for this app. The initial reviews gave me hope but use of the app proved otherwise. I give it 2 stars because it provides some benefit but know it could be so so much better. Hopefully updated versions and updates will offer  improvements.

5,2021-07-05 09:40:25,HBOooh,"I’m new to the Apple Watch, and this is the first series of apps I have purchased specifically for the watch (I bought the suite and recommend getting all three).

As a new watch owner, it’s been a bit overwhelming at times… I often have to search through apps on both the phone and the watch to find the data readout I want. This app is sooo very thorough and thereby complex. But after a week now I’m starting to know where things are. My advice is to just relax and give it time!

The depth of information and the amazing way that information is displayed make it well worth the effort of learning the three software packages (AutoSleep, AutoWake and HeartWatch). 

I’ve been suffering from serious chronic insomnia for several years now and it has been crippling. After using this app, I realized that my sleep wasn’t that bad after all… I just wasn’t getting enough, due to my own bad habits. With the incentive that HeartWatch has given me to exercise (walking for now), combined with the amazing sleep feedback from AutoSleep, I am somehow sleeping way better now… amazing! Still not perfect, but a huge improvement.

These apps work smoothly with the Apple Health app… the Health app is still useful, and serves as a snapshot. But when you want to dive deep into the data, you have this suite of apps.

I’m a bit of a complex person by nature (meaning I have a definite geek side that gets off on data and graphs). I find these apps simply delightful, and frankly an unbelievable value.

5,2018-12-23 22:22:55,4 U M8,"Had a Fitbit for a while, and it never could tell me how much sleep I had accumulated. Checked out sleep apps before buying the series 4 watch. And got this one right away.

Working 2 jobs, and time flies, and there are many times when I do not know how much time I actually accumulated in bed. Often been getting less than 6 and am wearing out later on. Fitbit, swear it lies, took it off after getting the Apple Watch 4.

Granted I've not had the app longer than 24 hours yet, so am not aware of the issues the previous reviewers had. Can say that last night was rough, muscles & feet were quite sore, so kept waking up throughout the night. At one point was thinking of getting up. Checked the watch app  nd seen I had 4 hours 30 minutes of sleep, so rolled back over. Plonked out till about 6 hours, app told me how long I slept. Tried to get another 2 hours, but only ended up with 7.5 hours.

App shows 7:30 hours sleep, 4:50 quality sleep, unsure on Readiness (in the yellow so probably means my body is not at full charge). Summary shows the goods in layman's terms:
Sleep 7:30, Quality 4:50, Avg pulse 58, Deep Sleep 1:02, Awake 0:29 (nature & checking phone).
This information tells me I should play the didgeridoo more before going to bed, which lowers AHI for those of us who use a CPAP, and playing the didgeridoo does help a person to sleep better (circular breathing helps!).

As for the setup, am disappointed somewhat. It ""assumes"" the user sleeps from a reference point of 5pm to Midnight. Well, I work past midnight, and I know of MANY others that work graveyard.
So, to make the app better, wizard wise, it should allow people to change their usual bedtime at any given point in a 24 hours period. I usually hit the sack at 3AM most nights, so had to set the Wizard at its max setting of Midnight.
Let us hope the app will learn when we sleep, and what days we stay up late and/or if we change routines on certain days for other jobs/tasks.

A couple of items I would like to see added:
Have a wake-up vibration after achieving a set point of sleep, where that may be 7 to 10 hours. Along that line, if it detects I have not gotten up past a certain specified time (30 minutes or an hour) to vibrate the watch again! Yeah, that would be bonza!
Have a meter or gauge that one can put on a watch face to show how much one has slept. This way a person can tap their watch to open it up, and quickly glance at how much they may have accumulated - without the need of pressing and tapping to achieve the same results.

Am hoping this will be a great sleep application! Would be good if it could recommend how to get better ""quality"" sleep, although I was playing didgeridoo music while sleeping to keep the busy part of the mind more calm.

5,2019-12-17 04:13:42,MarkMoriarty,"So glad I bought this bundle (along with HeartWatch from the same developer).

I charge my phone in the morning while getting ready, and then the watch has plenty battery to wear while sleeping each night. 

Sleep detection is extremely accurate — even for maps at random times in the day. 
It keeps you honest about how much sleep you're actually getting, and how regular (or not) your cycle is. 

See app screenshots for the various insights you can see. 
Heart rate analytics have even predicted I'm getting sick a day before I notice any other symptoms. 

The app is extremely customisable. Example: change colours. Example 2: say you sometimes wake up during the night, do something, and go back to bed: you can adjust the amount of time you have to be awake before the app splits your sleep into two distinct sleep sessions, vs one session with some time awake. 

I haven't used HeartWatch and AutoWake (from the same developer) so much, but still recommend you just buy the bundle. For 2% of the price of your watch you are unlocking an additional ~30% functionality. 

I delayed buying an Apple Watch for years, because I wanted to wait until they released a version with proper sleep tracking. I figured eventually they'd advertise a watch marketed to be worn 23.5 hours, with in-built sleep analytics like a FitBit. Even Series 5 isn't marketed like this. But actually, this app solves that need. I just bought an Apple Watch Series 3, and with this app, I couldn't ask for better sleep analysis.

5,2019-06-01 01:40:29,appoli13,"Due to my work & general personal habits I don’t get a huge amount of sleep and it’s tough for me to wake up in general. It was because of this that I first became interested in a ‘smart’ alarm (used sleep cycle originally way back before the watch & when you put the phone under your pillow). And since even if you have all the sensors you can get right now the sleep information they capture won’t exactly be amazing for a number of reasons, but this is what we have & if you’re going to use a smart alarm it’s most likely going to be done using this data. And still, there are more issues: the movement data captured by your watch cannot currently be implemented to set a wake time (at the moment only the heart rate your watch captures can be used, the motion data is analyzed after the fact on the phone - but it sounds like this is a priority for Apple so hopefully that should change within the next year or so) - this is where the phone based alarm clocks have an advantage. 

Originally there was no alarm clock for AutoSleep (there is AutoWake now, which has a number of nice features itself) so it won’t wake you up. But this app is great for documenting your sleeping habits, the effect they have on the sleep you get, and comparing the data against other smart alarm apps - this is how autosleep got my attention originally. Based on my recollection of what happened at night & how I felt I sifted through a number of apps (almost, if not, all the apps available at the time) and this was the winner in regard to accuracy, detail/data appoints, and usability  (lots of data points/metrics can make it a bit ‘much’ for some on the phone, but it captures everything automatically - you just need to tell it what you consider to be the crossover into the next day). 

I then used this app to find the smart alarm that I felt worked the best & had a good featureset (I found Pillow to be my favorite smart alarm/sleep tracker - however with the watch now you don’t actually get a ‘smart alarm’, but they do give you a haptic alarm at the cost of a massive amount of battery power now & audio recording + various nap timers). 

With the new complications for the new watch faces I have taken all the old apps, and some new, back out for a spin and it’s still clear that autosleep is still at the top of its class. In both data capture & data display. The autowake alarm also does a great job. It uses heart rate, and I would think time elapsed, to guesstimate what cycle your in and can gently tap you awake. It does all this while require much less battery vs Pillow, but you do need to give autowake it’s own complication so that it can do its business in the background. Since autosleep complications handle the display of sleep info the autowake complication just tells you if the alarm is off or on & when for. Not the best use of real estate, but céste la vie. Autosleep is still a gem!",False,One of the best (if not the best) sleep tracking apps.... And it does it automatically!,

AutoSleep has absolutely met my expectations, I used to use FitBit’s sleep function and before that my Jawbone UP!’s app.

I did the most research around the Jawbone app and found that it was *very* accurate and was happy with it. If only the hardware was a bit more durable. The UP! wristband kept failing after around 6-8 months.

Next was FitBit, I got a good deal on a FitBit Charge HR 2 through my work and have been using it for well over 2 years. I felt it’s sleep recording was nowhere near as accurate as the UP! but it was good enough for a gross relative estimate of how I’m doing night by night.

I picked up an Apple Watch Series 4 and, after a bit of research settled on AutoSleep.

Wow.

In addition to it being at LEAST as accurate as the UP! (blowing the FitBit completely out of the water), it has more stats and tweaks than you can shake a stick at!

I admit it was initially overwhelming and I pretty much ignored all but the most basic stats at first. But after a few days I got my bearings and started to see what it’s capturing and how it relates to the real world. I’m *very* impressed with this app. 

If you forget to tell it you're going to sleep it does an excellent job of figuring that out on its own. If you want to tell it when you’re putting your head down (to figure out how long it takes you to fall asleep once you start trying) you can do that too.

It sends me a nice summary of my night’s sleep at 10 AM the next day that helps me stay aware. And it detects naps with great accuracy so those properly count when evaluating your fatigue.

4,2017-08-20 16:39:59,@srdvx,"I first didn't get this app and had to come back to it. 
The main thing to know is that it starts to be any useful when you have Apple Watch, without it, don't bother, it was my pitfall. 
It very cleverly analyzes events between your iPhone and Apple Watch, based on the very flexible settings about your use of the devices, such as ever falling asleep with your phone in bed vs always having it in charge when you sleep, and, similarly, ever wearing the Watch to bed  vs. always have it in charge. 
But I really like the ability to review the night and adjust that maybe that night I did fall asleep with my phone in bed, or forgot to take my the Watch off. 
The goal of this app if to keep track of the accurate amount of time you spend in bed *sleeping*.
And it not only figures out the time slept in bed, but also when you might have dozed off in front of the computer (it's called ""All Sleep"", right?). 
But this is when you enter a gray area from the perspective of the app having the correct account of events -- such as when you left your phone on your desk and Watch on charge and did something elsewhere, *AND* from the perspective of whether a 45 minute nap on your keyboard should be even counted as a proper sleep, while it may be still questionable whether you indeed were napping in your keyboard or just left your devices behind. 
I supposed the app is most useful for people with a very high workload and sleeping disorders, or just poor sleep discipline, which kinda connected one to the other, and its ability to pick up the bits as pieces of sleep you might have gotten while switching off while sitting in the conference presentation. But if you do that, you really do have a hight ""sleep deficit"" and just by the virtue of showing these accidental naps, it can be telling you to introduce some sleep discipline into your main sleep schedule. 
But ultimately it relies on your wearing your Watch when you are not in bed, and *always* having your phone on your person, at least when you are not in bed. 
The fact that it analyses data from both devices, gives you some room to deviate from always having your phone on you if you wearing your Watch, so if do wear the Watch with good predictability and have a habit to leave your phone on the desk or elsewhere, it will be very helpful. 
Ultimately though, you would want to minimize needing to review and adjust counting of those bits and pieces of sleep that it may have captured, correctly or incorrectly, and based I whether you want them counted as real sleep or not. 
(For some people it's worth capturing all sleep you can get, even when it's your body overriding your plans and takes a time out. Getting to this point is unhealthy, but knowing that you have gotten to this point and having factual documentation of this pattern will serve your to take some corrective actions vs. kind of like just knowing that this happens sometimes.
Having solid data about anything subjective is very helpful, because it makes it objective, but again, you have to make sure that this type of data truly reflects the reality,
so reviewing your stats, at least initially, is essential, until you have a level of confidence that the device usage habits you have configured in the app are the actual habits, not your wishful thinking about what you would have liked them to be.
And the app does a good job allowing you to review, adjust, and approve the amount of sleep captured every day. 

I cannot comment on the AI/self-learning abilities in the app based on such manual adjustments though. I think it's classic case when you could use self-learning, but if your patterns of behavior in terms of having your devices in you always change, then it would defeat the purpose, but still would allow you to keep the accurate record of sleep. 
Improvements:
I would have wanted an ability to see the portion of my overall sleep which came from naps, then I would not have to make decisions on whether to record those naps towards normal sleep, so I wouldn't be manipulating the results of the App's analysis based on the device behavior, which would in term allow the app to really learn how i am using my devices. 
2) Although I am not a Mac user, I imagine that including data about usage of my computer would enhance the correctness if the results captured in the app
2.1) by extension of the last thought, having a monitoring client in all my computers, desktops and laptops, Mac's and PC's, would only get us closer to having accurate data while minimizing the need (and time [!!!] it takes to review and correct the stats created by the App to ensure they are correct. 
2) Lastky, which flows from the previous suggestion, to the next logical step  would be including readings that are provided by other devices, wearable or not, which are all aggregated (or accumulated) in the Health App to which this app has or can have access. For example I have FitBit Flex 2 which keeps track of my sleep and exercise, even though not always perfectly, if I forget to put the device back into the bracelet from the charging doc. 
I also have an under-mattress monitor, which captures my being in bed (and a whole lot more about my sleep) but which would not distinguish on the sleep/not-sleep level if I am typing something on my phone while in bed (this may me derived from the the detail record of my physical parameters this device captures but those are all not written in the Health App, only the summary is, and in it one would have to check the sleep stage of each sleep segment, resulting in a record, to see whether it should be counted as sleep. 

In all, figuring out the true amount of quality sleep a person gets can be tricky even with such specialized sleep devices,
and this AllSleep App took an approach of integrating the data from multiple devices. 
Using more information from more available devices would only help to get closer to the truth without custom input from the user.

1,2018-02-24 15:52:51,Jennicoba,"While the layout is beautiful, I've been using this app for 5 days and felt like it had some inaccuracies, but wanted to give it a fair try. Last night was a terrible night of sleep for me. I laid in bed an hour awake, finally got up to take some meds, and then proceeded to toss and turn all night. I know this because I wear an ear plug (snoring husband) and every time I turn over, I switch it to the other ear. I counted doing this 6 times, laying there several minutes after each time begging for sleep to find me. Because I know for a fact my sleep was awful, I immediately went to the app when I woke up to see what it recorded. Apparently, it thinks I had more than 8 hours of restful sleep (94%....hahaha), minimum restlessness, and 0 minutes awake in bed and didn't even track when I literally was awake, standing and walking. Absolutely no accuracy to the reality and I am incredibly disappointed. I deleted it immediately. As someone with incredible sleep issues, I need an app that more accurately accounts for awake time and restlessness, especially because my doctor and I are trying to find the right medications to help with my insomnia (I've been on 3 that failed to work). If I showed her this, she'd believe my insomnia was cured. I truly believe that all the 5 star ratings are from people who may not have sleep struggles or insomnia because I've noticed many of the 1 & 2 stars are from people who do-people who truly want quality sleep apps to help them with genuine sleep concerns. If you have decent sleep and just want a record of that, this app is fine. If you struggle with insomnia, don't waste your money. Hopefully the developer will fix the inaccuracies AND the way reviews are displayed. They're doesn't seem to be any logical order. Mar, Feb, 1yr, June, Oct, April....

3,2020-01-25 11:33:49,jrowellfx,"I had extensive email discussions with the developer about the following bug (descr below) some many months ago but he seems unwilling to deal with it. Not a show stopper but it is annoying.

The sleep app has to consider the start of a “day” from the point of view of a night’s sleep, as offset and slightly different (eg 9pm, the default) from the actual start of the day (i.e., 12am) so that when you go to bed at 10pm it counts your sleep at that time towards the next day coming up, so that when you wake up the next morning it counts the previous hours from 10pm-12am towards your sleep for that day. 

Well, the bug is, if you sleep say from 10pm to 11pm, wake up, check the app to see how long you slept, it reports nonsense or “error”. Once you sleep again into the next morning, then check again the next morning, the app then correctly reports your hours sleep from 10pm-11pm the night before.

This bug becomes quite apparent if you change your default start of your sleep day to say 6pm, and you are in the habit of going to bed early but wake up before midnight and want to see how long you slept.

Anyway l was dismissed as being the only person who ever reported this bug but that seems irrelevant to me. A bug is a bug, fix it please. I know it’s a bug because since the discussions with the dev, I’ve gone through a phone update AND clean reinstall AND not changing the default start-of-sleep-day BUT the bug has persisted.

Otherwise, I do believe this is the best sleep tracker available, and would gladly issue 5 stars if not for this issue and the perplexing exchange I had with the dev some time ago.",False,Great app except for one annoying unsquashed bug!,

—————
This is still a good app, but I can’t call it a great app anymore. The latest update brought design changes that look sleek, but which are uninformative. Humans aren’t meant to “read” circle graphs - I know Apple is all about “closing the rings”, but that doesn’t change the fact that it’s not a design that people can easily understand or interpret. Graphs that I used to look at are gone (or otherwise buried so deep in the new interface that may as well have been removed) and the color scheme is a mess of rainbows. Part of me can see that this is an earnest attempt to improve the app, but the other part of me is so disappointed in the way data is presented that I really can’t applaud it. Please consider putting the heart rate graph front and center like Sleep Cycle does and switching to bar graphs or another presentation method that is easier for humans to understand.

Previous Review: (5 Stars)
I’ve probably used almost every other sleep tracking app out there for Apple Watch (and a few other fitness trackers as well), so I feel confident saying that AutoSleep is the absolute best of the bunch. Once it’s setup , everything is just like it says in the name - automatic.

For accurate results, I wear my watch to bed. This works out nicely even with the limited battery life, since I charge the watch while I shower. 

Perfect integration with Apple Health and a fair one-time cost! This is the app you’re looking for. 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟",False,Latest update puts style over substance,

2,2018-01-20 18:11:54,ChrisPlz,"I bought this app because I wanted a sleep tracker that was tied into my Apple Watch so I could track my restlessness as I sleep. I was hoping this app would do the one thing I wanted really well. Instead, it tracks 5 or 6 things (4 or 5 of which I don’t care about), with mediocrity. The data is a sensory overload, and changing settings is extremely cumbersome (I have to go through the wizard to change notification preferences instead of a simple settings page).

This app tracks my movement throughout the day (which Apple’s own activity tracker does anyway, and better). It tracks when my watch is on the charger (really?), it tracks my heart rate while I sleep (apple has a heart rate monitor already), which is cool to see the correlation, but the diversity of data being visualized is a bit much (line graph of heart emojis). 

All of these tracking features lead to a horrible user interface (a line graph of heart emojis for heart rate), an ugly circle graph with 4 rings. As a software developer that works with data visualizations, I found it hard to grok how to navigate around and find out how things work.

I don’t like how it determines sleep quality either. It’s based on a baseline “preferred hours of sleep”, which is kind of wonky IMO. If I go to bed early enough, and wake up late enough, but have a horrible night of tossing, turning, and waking up periodically, I can still achieve 100% sleep quality (which seems horribly inaccurate). I prefer how my alarm app Sleep Cycle determines sleep quality. If I have a bad night of sleep, regardless of the hours I slept, it’s clearly noticeable. 

Honestly, this app has so much potential, but it just tries to do too much.",False,Not worth the money,

5,2017-02-01 19:59:58,Israelu,"I'm updating my review for the new version of the app. What follows past this paragraph is my original review which stays unchanged. I simply wanted to add to my praise by pointing out how actively the developer has been refining what was a brilliant app coming out of the gate. In the less than 2 months this app's been out, the developer has managed to push out 2 MAJOR updates.  He clearly cares about his product and listens heavily to feedback. Seriously, if you're in the market for a sleep tracker, I'd definitely back this horse (so to speak). 

This is the sleep tracker I've been waiting for. The auto tracking is brilliant, and, at least for me (your mileage may vary), worked absolutely perfectly with the default settings. As nice as that is, what I truly appreciate about the app is how robust the analysis is. I tried 3 or 4 other Apple Watch sleep trackers,  but I really missed the fuller analysis I got from full iPhone apps (although placing the phone on the bed didn't work for me - hence watch apps). As a huge fan of Heart Watch, I knew I had to try it. The developer has a particular kind of genius, and that is for taking data sets and correlating them in a way that creates new data. Auto Sleep reflects that same genius. 
I don't disagree with critics who'd like to see their data over longer stretches of time, but the value for me is in what a product DOES, and what it does certainly provides a 5 star value.",False,Finally,

With the series 2 and new Watch OS it is now easier to get two days of battery life allowing easier use of sleep tracking apps. I purchased and tried 4 different apps before coming across this one and I am not disappointed at all. It doesn't require an app installation on the Watch itself but provides accurate information for me thus far (I would say 85% but I am also someone who wakes up a lot at night) the information is the most detailed of any sleep tracking app on iOS and as a beta tester I can tell you that the developer is doing a great job answering questions / concerns with extremely quick feedback. I can also say that one can expect this app to be updated and constantly improving. It does integrate well with heart Watch (the developers other highly rated app) and both are well worth the investment as I doubt Apple will introduce sleep tracking anytime soon. The only downside is that the format can be a little confusing and can take time to get used to but as mentioned developer is working on constantly improving app.",False,Will keep getting better,

Also, my major buy was made because it had the best ratings out of them all.  This is not the case AT ALL. My Apple Watch is brand new. I've only had it one month. (Let's get that straight 😂.) When I went to bed the first night, I put my watch on and went to sleep. When I got up, I checked my phone and the app and NOTHING had been read in the night. NOTHING. I email acquiring about how to get the app to work right and why it wasn't showing data. The person blamed my watch and gave me some instructions to follow ""as many others have had to do and many have been helped."" So why make the app saying you can fall asleep and wake up to data when really a help rep has to help you out?! Then of course they already got your money so it doesn't matter.

Well, here we are today and I've changed my tune.  Auto Sleep is a COMPLETE and COMPREHENSIVE sleep monitoring app.  I'm completely satisfied without compromise on the sleep resolution that this app provides.

I found that many apps you have to star and stop manually and thought that if I just get into the habit of it, it will be fine.  However, I found that I forgot to turn it on or off most of the time despite even setting alarms to remind me to do so. 
Frustrated, I looked for more in hopes of find one that could start and stop automatically and track many areas of your sleep (times in different zones, HR, patterns etc) & I found this one.  Reluctantly, I paid the $ and I haven't yet been disappointed.

I switched from Fitbit to an Apple Watch several months ago and have been hunting for an app that auto-detects sleep. This does that and more. Years of insomnia had me in a napping pattern that made the insomnia worse. The ""recharge"" and ""quality"" ratings let me actually time those naps to keep me sane but mostly on a nighttime schedule.

I even had four surgeries on my nose and throat to open up my airways. I also bought an adjustable bed to raise me up into an elevated head position. 

When I got an Apple Watch, one of my initial goals was to track my sleep quality. I got two sleep apps. AutoSleep won out. The analysis showed me how poor my sleep quality was. I tried a few pieces of my expensive equipment individually to see which was helping me the most. It turns out that if I combine the mouthpiece, the cpap, and a slightly elevated head, I can achieve deep sleep for a large portion of the night. Without AutoSleep and the watch, I wouldn't have known what worked best, and I never would have tried both devices together. Combined, I can tolerate them. I needed the the open throat and the forced air together, neither worked well alone.

For runners, cyclists, triathletes, etc. it's a great tool to compare sleep quality and 'waking heart rate' to gauge how well your body is recovered from intense workout cycles. There are some reviews that criticize the 'waking heart rate' as not really your lowest 'resting heart rate'. It is true that the app uses its own algorithm for WHR, while typically higher than your lowest resting heart rate, it is still a very consistent measure for gauging recovery day in and day out. Great app! I wish more apps truly made insightful use of all the available data. Of course there will be variation between users.

This app actually shows me the pattern of sleep that I was  used to seeing. So far it seems really accurate. It catches time awake. Different levels of movement. It really gives a good pattern of what the night looked like. 

Best of all. Its not installed on the watch. I don't need to turn it on or off. It just read the motion data stored by the watch.

I’ve had tremendous success with the Keto diet and was looking to fine tune my weight loss. One of the items to prolong keto burning is to evaluate sleep quality and duration (Dr. Berg on YouTube) As a single mom of course I wasn’t getting enough sleep and seeing the data on AutoSleep motivated me to start going to sleep earlier. Since I started 2 months ago with AutoSleep I’ve started choosing sleep over aimlessly staying up. At first I was only looking at the levels of sleep graph, and time asleep. I love that it exports to AppleHealth and my keto tracking app (CM) As I learn my way around AutoSleep I’m finding more ways to understand the data and love the app even more. It’s like having a good friend that tells you the truth about yourself that otherwise you would not know.

After complaining for the past ten years, the practitioners had written my sleep problems off as a “mental health issue.” It was only because I started using AutoSleep and showed up with five months of solid documentation (which I demanded be added to my permanent medical records), that I finally was prescribed a sleep study. At the conclusion of the study, the technician and I compared their official, hospital-based results with the data tracked by AutoSleep and the AutoSleep results were spot-on, almost exactly marching. This helped me defend myself with the health practitioners so that they no longer can dismiss my complaints as “in your head” and “impossible.” Also, because it tracks my heart rate, it helped me when I complained of illness that included extremely rapid heartbeat at night that was unusual for me. The ER doctor told me, “85-100 bpm is normal at night.” I was able to pull out my six months of history and show him that for me, it was way high out-of-range given that I’m consistently in a range of 55-70 bpm at night, so 95-110 bpm isn’t okay...and only because of this data was I tested for infection and found to have an unusual and severe bacterial infection.

I have to say though, after using this app for a few years with my Apple watch, even though I still always use my old Android with that old app to track my sleep, other than redundancy and comparison, I don't think it represents a value add anymore, because this app lets me geek out to all the data tracking and analysis my heart desires.

1. In the AutoSleep App set up the app to detect you’re awake when phone activity is detected.

2. From your Apple Watch in the AutoSleep App (before going to sleep), manually select “Lights Off” by scrolling to the very bottom of the app face. 

“Lights Off” will now detect when you fall asleep as it usually takes me about 10 - 15 minutes or so to actually fall asleep. When your alarm goes off (or your AutoWake app alerts you for those who purchased the full Auto app collection from this dev), I pick up my iPhone and go straight to the AutoSleep app and slide down to refresh. Be sure to refresh your iPhone app so that your sleep time can automatically be logged in your Apple Watch app. Go to your Day/Edit tab on your iPhone app and you’ll see a timeline of your nights sleep along with when you woke up to use the bathroom, etc. and when you fell back asleep.

5,2018-01-29 19:53:45,JimWilson.BocaRaton,"Auto Sleep and Heart Watch (the Developer’s companion App for AutoSleep) for Apple Watch - these guys really take their Apps seriously. APPLE INC should recognize these Apps at 2018 WWDC Conference, these apps ARE that good. I’m a CARDIAC Patient and use these two Apps for my Cardiologist and GP,  along with KARDIA a device smaller than a Credit Card that will record ones EKG using your iPhone, or Apple Watch. Get these two Apps no matter your age. Tracking Heart & Sleep activity, resting heart rates etc is very important for overall health. When these App developers provide an update, they provide incredible care for the user experience.

5,2017-12-20 04:05:31,CaLiGuLa_,The most recent update (12/18/17) is definitely a leap forward in form and function.  Having the ability to edit previous days is proving very useful.  Drag down to update clock is also coming in very handy.  There are more cool features and improvements I can mention but the bottom line is that AutoSleep is now even better.,False,New and Improved,
4,2017-12-23 06:08:57,Leese ,Last update 12/2017. App doesn’t want to pull info from watch.  Says no update for OH 32m ?? What does that even mean?,False,Great app BUT,

Also the graphical representation is highly confusing and not easy to understand.The app should add simplicity in analyzing the sleep and must do accurate analytics on the sleep data rather than just assuming .

I am not satisfied with this app and will definitely ask Apple to refund my dollars back.",False,I am not at all satisfied!!,

So when you make adjustments to sleep sensor parameters for one day, it messes up the historical sleep values too. For someone that has a set sleep schedule everyday, this would be fine. But for those whom have irregular sleep patterns, the app becomes a proverbial game of whack-a-mole. I'd advise on waiting till this app gets updated to allow night by night adjustments (the tweaks don't work if the sensors are saying you're awake). I'm 

Update: 7/27/17

The app is broken again, for whatever reason the app is terrible at detecting sleep now when you sleep at 1 am till the morning. There should be a night owl mode that allows for more accuracy for this kind of lifestyle.",False,Almost good.,
3,2017-04-24 11:32:47,Petypop,"Update 04/24/17: I don't like the home screen in the latest update. The white clock face with narrow data lines around the edge was much easier to interpret than the fat purple sleep line around a dark screen. jmo. 

 This is hands down the best sleep tracking app I have used. I own a Apple Watch, Fitbit and a Mio slice and have taken turns wearing two at time to bed. The Apple Watch combined with the Autosleep app nails it every time. The user interface took a couple of days for me to fully understand but now I can't think of a better way to view my stats.
Tip: be sure your watch is snug on your wrist when you go to bed.",False,Best sleep tracking app.,

5,2017-02-25 14:19:54,raymi0603,"I have a heart condition + other medical issues and the MD recommended that I keep track of my sleep, walk and other vital information.  I purchased and wore a Fitbit in order to monitor these. 
However, why have an Apple Watch and still have to wear another monitor. As such,I thought I give Auto Sleep a try. At first I was skeptical and decided to just give it "" a try"". I'm glad I did. The app is very easy to use. Just set it and forget it. 
When you first open the app, the app will ask you certain questions during setup time you go to sleep, time you wake up etc. After the initial setup just put the watch to charge while watching tv, reading a book before you go to sleep, then put the watch on before you go to sleep. The app automatically records your sleep time, how well you slept, heart rate, restless time etc. 
Then it automatically syncs the info to the apple health app where all your health data is stored. It's great to have all my health information in one place. Now, when I go to the MD I can provide him all my health information in one place as opposed to searching various apps. 
I highly recommend this app for anyone who wants to monitor their sleep activity. Great app!",False,Great sleep app. Best sleep tracker in App Store,

Does not matter how many time you sleep or how ofen. Most importantly it works automatically through your Apple 🍎 Watch. I have downloaded it many other before applications seeking for this one and I finally got it.,False,Amazing ❤ Application,
