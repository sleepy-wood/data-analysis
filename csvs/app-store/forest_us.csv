Forest is my new favorite app,5,2019-05-13 02:08:11,False,Jo_Wiley_49,"I’ll be honest: I’m a student, and I spend WAY TOO MUCH time on my phone. It is a major distraction and I can feel myself getting sucked in but was having trouble ever convincing myself to just put it down and get stuff done. I never buy apps (I only go for the free versions of everything) — I literally just paid actual money for my first app ever earlier this year, after owning a smart phone for the past 6 years. This app is well worth the $2. It helps motivate me to stay off my phone when I’m practicing (music student) or trying to get work done. My boyfriend also has the app and we’ve made rooms to help us both focus simultaneously a few times but I’m hoping to get more friends to buy it so I can do this more. It is the perfect combination of motivating and making you feel disappointed in yourself if you slip up 😂 Seriously, it’s so satisfying to watch your forest grow and it’s very easy to use. You can also create new “tags” for why the trees were planted, which I love (I made one specific for practicing which is also a good way to help me keep track of how much practice I do). I had tried setting time limits for screen time/social media through iPhone settings but I’ve already started ignoring that....but Forest is so much more convincing and I just can’t let my sweet little trees die lol. Overall I love love this app and wish I’d heard of it sooner! It’s a relief to have something really hold me accountable for my screen time!",
"Consistent user since 2016, love it!",5,2022-03-28 15:00:50,False,nessesque,"Hey forest team. I rarely ever post reviews, but I feel after this many years this app deserves my effort. I’ve been using this to help me focus since 2016 and have literally logged hundreds and hundreds of hours using this. It’s helped me with highschool, college, technical programs, and other courses. I’ve even used it to track my meditation and personal reading. I just want to say thank you. I have a ridiculously difficult time focusing thanks to a myriad of mental health issues that are quite literally out of my control. This app has been a game changer for me and I hope other people can have the same experience.

I also just wanted to voice some issues that I’ve had with the app (not very many at al but I know your development team is strong and actually takes reviews seriously). One issue is with the friends feature. I’ve tried to get many people to join the app and plant trees with me but I feel like each time it’s pretty difficult. That process could maybe be a bit more streamlined? One more thing is I think that I’ve noticed the app slow down as I’ve been using it. Maybe it’s because how much data I have logged in it? Not sure. It doesn’t affect the functionality too much but just something I’ve noticed.

All in all, hands down the best app I’ve had the pleasure of using. Again, thank you. If I could give more the 5 stars I would.",
Great for studying,5,2020-12-19 22:44:55,False,Disarray Human Being,"Honestly, I’m the type of person who just suddenly goes on my phone or laptop in the middle of doing homework, projects, etc. It’s especially been a problem since this new school year started. This app has helped me quite a lot, though sometimes I forget to plant a tree before I begin completing assignments. It’s helped with decreasing the amount of time I spend on schoolwork, and makes me feel like I’m doing so much more. Whenever I do reach over to my phone and am about to do something besides studying, like scrolling through Instagram, I’d open it and see the tree on my screen. Then, I’d ask myself, “Do I really want the tree to die?” I’d say no. In the beginning of using this app, I was always close to using my phone while the tree is growing. I began to develop a mentality after a few days that I should finish my homework before going on my phone and do other things. Of course, I sometimes still do it when I don’t use Forest, but I feel as if I’ve lessened the amount. This is the first productivity app I’ve used, and I’ve always seen people recommend it. It’s definitely an app worth the money. You can use it on your laptop or computer as well, as a Chrome extension (which is what I started out with). It’s simple to use, and has a minimalistic aesthetic that I really enjoy. Overall, it’s a great app.",
Honestly a game-changer,5,2019-02-17 18:00:22,False,KezOnDemand,"Don’t get me wrong, my phone is a useful tool, and I wouldn’t necessarily say I’m addicted to it. However, it’s also a super easy way to waste time you don’t even realize you could be using on other things. I use Forest mostly in small increments, and it keeps me from picking up my phone whenever I have a few free minutes and get bored. Since I don’t actually need or want to be on my phone, the small motivation of growing little bushes and trees is enough for me to direct my attention elsewhere- and it turns out that those few free minutes throughout the day can translate into a lot of extra productivity!

Otherwise: initial download price might seem a bit high, but considering that they plant real trees if you make enough coins to buy the option, the $2 is warranted. Coin prices in the app are average, but payment per tree during the week is okay and you can make enough yourself with a little effort (I personally think you should make a little more per tree than they offer, but it’s not a bad amount either). The interface is simple and intuitive, the art is charming and stylistically uniform, and my favorite part- the white noise options- are incredibly helpful for studying and neither overly expensive or so complicated that they become distracting.

All in all, great app that I use frequently. $2 has never bought me so much extra productivity.",
Totally Worth the Money,5,2021-02-23 19:31:01,False,AmyR1101,"This is the app that’s got me through middle school and two years of high school. I don’t have a diagnosed focusing disorder, but I get writing blocks and procrastinate a lot. Like, a LOT. This app has helped me so, so much. It’s really got everything you could ask for. An amazing user interface, currency that you get  from focusing, fake (and real) trees that you can plant to make a beautiful forest out of focusing, tags so you know where you’re spending time focusing, and really cool analysis tools that show you what days and what times you focus the most. This is the one of the only apps that I would say is completely worth your money. The tech team is really amazing, I reached out to them about an issue I had and within a day they responded and within a week had fixed the issue. I’ve also for years been pushing for a stopwatch feature in their feedback survey(as a student I don’t always know how long homework will take) and they listened! The only things I guess I would say could be better would be the leaderboard, since it’s worldwide and there are some people who use the app to just get away from their phone, so they can have seriously high hours and it’s really impossible to beat if you use Forest for studying. Overall, amazing app that has literally changed my life in a positive way.",
"Amazing App, I Highly Recommend It",5,2019-04-18 04:54:51,False,Boedinator,"I have been slacking off and pushing off a lot of responsibilities lately and recently I heard a student in one of my classes mention this app and how you can grow little trees and a forest and I thought that was amazing, the second I got home I checked out the app and decided to buy it, one of the best $2 I have ever spent, I’m staying way more productive lately and I love seeing the little trees get planted, it has great graphics and design and is really simple to use. When I saw there was also an option in the app to plant real trees to help the environment I thought that was absolutely amazing and made me feel really happy for getting the app and supporting the developers. I have also just recently purchased the other app by the same developers called SleepTown and it is also amazing, it has been helping me have better sleeping habits and I have been way more productive and active during the day and just feel over all happier and healthier and feel like I’m getting my life back on track. I would recommend both of these apps to everyone, I have been telling my family and friends about it a lot and how it’s helped me and they love it too.

Great app,5,2019-05-08 22:58:45,False,Peace4KT,I love this that it helps me stay focused and I can get enough of it you get trees and depending on how long your focus for depends how many coins you get because every 20 minutes you get seven points but anything like 25 minutes or how are you hat you can plant a tree anything lower than 25 minutes is a bush and any cool events you get cool trees the best part is is that you can’t buy anything but you can’t pay for coins you can’t cheat so the only way to get coins is you have to play the app for a while and it’s not technically a gameTechnically it’s not a game but such a cool thing to have if you’re having trouble staying focused like me I would totally recommend this app but anyone who is looking for a game to play don’t take this up but if your having a little bit of trouble I suggest taking a try at it it will be deafly worth the while of two box rather than going for the cheaper version the free one which was Flor at no offense but the only way you can login is my Facebook but this one is much more accurate and definitely the more original version I would’ve definitely done this if this was definitely free but it still worth two dollars you pay at the very beginning I would totally go for this app if you are really need some help focusing.,
"Easy, motivating, effective",5,2018-08-16 04:10:21,False,ijustgetbored,"I downloaded the app for work productivity, but it’s made me hyper-aware of how often I actually pick up my phone. For any task, just having the reminder that my phone is not currently available to me is extremely helpful. I’m realizing that I waste a ton of time that stems from, say, just looking at a text that could wait until later. Moral: don’t think this app isn’t useful because you’re not at a desk all day. It has countless uses. 

I agree with what other users have said about gamification being a good motivator, and the user interface is very appealing. Creating and naming tags produces helpful data. For instance, if you’re concerned about work-life balance, you can see a colorful pie chart with a few simple clicks. 

One thing: I’m fine with how the trees become more “expensive” as time passes. However, it can take a long, long time to gain sufficient coins after awhile. I’m not asking for instant and easy gratification, because that’s contrary to the spirit of the app. I think adding more achievement bonuses (that don’t depend on having friends that use the app or on leaderboard performance) would be great. Unlocking achievements is also rewarding and something to strive for, so I’d love to see more!","{'id': 4695724, 'body': 'Hello,\n\nThank you for your feedback. \nWe will forward your suggestions to our team.\n\nFeel free to contact us via our in-app feedback system if you have further questions. :) - Forest', 'modified': '2018-08-17T02:08:36Z'}"
100% RECOMMEND!!!,5,2021-04-07 17:42:20,False,Alired22,"If you are on the fence about buying this app, take this as a sign to purchase and download it. This app is so fun and motivating. I have tried other methods like the Pomodoro technique, but it doesn’t seem to work. However, as someone who sometimes has trouble staying focused and getting things done, this app is helpful than one may realize. I love plants so this app is definitely for me. I get excited once I have planted things in my forest and sometimes don’t even feel like I am working because I am motivated to make my plants and forest grow. And I am disappointed when one of my plants die. Maybe it is just me but I also love how I am encouraged by receiving coins, which I can use to buy different types of other beautiful plants of my choice (which just motivates me even more). I love the aesthetic of the app and don’t know where I would be without this app. I spend A LOT of time on my phone, so the Deep Focus setting that kills my plant if I exit the Forest app is amazing. Because I hate seeing my plants die. I hold my forest in my heart and love watching it get bigger and bigger. The app is the best.

Incredible for people with ADHD,5,2022-03-03 22:36:11,False,katencheyenne,"As someone with ADHD who struggles infinitely with focus and maintaining my attention on one thing, especially with a phone within my grasp, this app has been an absolute life-saver. Before I started using this I would zone out, mindlessly pick up my phone, get lost on social media or some app, and completely forget I had been working or doing school work to begin with. As soon as I unlock my phone and see the Forest app open, I’m reminded of the task I was originally trying to focus on and it prevents those rabbit holes I would get lost in. 

Getting to see the physical manifestation of your focus and hard work is priceless. Not only do you get to see your forest and know that each individual tree represents 2 hours of focus, but you can look at each day, week, month, year to see the exact amount of hours you spent. I was really down on myself and felt like I wasn’t spending enough time studying. This app made me realize I’m actually spending a full 40 hour work week on homework, studying, tests, etc. It was a confidence boost that I am actually putting in the work.",
Helps with my ADHD!,5,2021-04-25 18:51:21,False,TotumReviews,"I have ADHD so I tend to getting easily distracted by my brain. I’ve been using the free chrome extension which helped, but then I would just go on my phone instead. I was hesitant to buy the app but it was really worth it. You feel kinda guilty if you end up going off task and kill a tree, which sounds bad but it really helps keep you on track. Once your in the groove of whatever you’re doing you don’t even notice that the time you set aside has been up already! If you’re a student that procrastinates, this is great for you! You can set the time and use it for more than just studying: breaks, cleaning, drawing, writing. Some of my only complaints are the price. Even though is pretty cheap, there is a desktop Chrome extension of this that’s 100% free. You’re only limited to only one tree and a bush which gets boring after continuous use; and if you want a different tree it’s only in the mobile, which is rather annoying. Other than that, it’s very versatile and user-friendly no matter the age. Very well done. 👍🏼",

There is a feature where you can have the app continue counting time after the tree finshes growing, so you can work around the problem by planting a short-time tree and then just continuing to not disturb it. But it would be really great if there was some sort of pause feature, maybe with some limitation like not earning coins if you pause it so that people don’t take advantage of it to ‘cheat’ on their time. Or maybe something where you can erase or reset the time, so you don’t have to feel bad about killing a cute little tree when you actually legitimately needed to use your phone for a minute.","{'id': 5787835, 'body': 'Hello,\n\nThank you for your feedback. \nWe will forward your suggestions to our team.\n\nFeel free to contact us via our in-app\nfeedback system if you have further questions. :) - Forest', 'modified': '2018-11-03T12:32:44Z'}"
This is the only app I’ve ever truly loved,5,2018-05-22 21:33:32,False,mollielarue,"I’ve never reviewed an app before, but I love this app so much. I downloaded it after my previous pomodoro timer app, tide, stopped timing correctly, which was literally all it had to do. The timer on this app works, with reliable notifications, and the “gamification” of being focused may seem silly, but it adds a cute and fun element to using a pomodoro timer. Also, the ability to tag how I spend my time (ex: work vs all other things) is an easy way to stay balanced. For instance, I can see if I’m falling behind on daily meditating even if it’s something I’m not conscious of. I can also see someone using this app not necessarily to boost concentration but as a way to literally bar yourself from using your phone for periods of time when you need to be present (ex: during a meeting or with a friend). One more thing I love: I just finished a project that took two months, and I went back and looked at my little forests for that time. Each lil tree helped me get that project done. It’s such a beautiful reminder that everything big happens with many tiny steps!",
"Great app and idea, but could you consider adding this feature?",5,2019-01-03 21:23:08,False,SCASM,"Hello,

First off, I love this idea and the app is well designed and visually appealing, great job on that! If you could add the option to have an unlimited timer, and the ability to pause that timer, this app would be exceptional. I guess not so much a timer, and more of a stopwatch since it would be counting time forward. It would be really cool to have multiple trees grow in a day, maybe one tree every two hours or something. I like keeping track of how much time I spend studying, but I can't pause the app's timer if, for example, I want to grab a quick bite or use the bathroom. Maybe an option to not kill the tree if you exit the app would be nice, too. I understand that the point of the app is to get people to not use their phone and be productive, but some of us have note card apps on our phones (ex. Anki) that we use, and so I would want the time spent doing note cards on my phone to also count towards growing trees! 

So basically I'm asking for a stopwatch feature to the app, that would be amazing!","{'id': 6678745, 'body': 'Hello,\n\nThank you for your feedback. \nWe will forward your suggestions to our team.\n\nFeel free to contact us via our in-app\nfeedback system if you have further questions. :) - Forest', 'modified': '2019-01-04T15:46:12Z'}"
"Got it for the cute interface, stayed for the productivity increase",5,2019-05-09 16:34:35,False,Mutant K,"I’ve only been using this app for around a week, but it’s already cut down on the amount of time I absent-mindedly use my phone.  Initially I got it mostly for how cute the little forests look, I’ll admit, and for the fact that earning enough in-game currency lets you plant a REAL tree!  Now, it even helps me keep my phone away when going to bed (a big hurdle for me), since I set it to the longest break setting (2 hr) as I’m laying down.

Obviously, how people use their phone-free time will vary.  For me, it’s allowed (forced?) me to eat my meals uninterrupted by scrolling, and I’ve begun creating art more frequently again (as I would always get stuck in the loop of “looking for inspiration” on my phone and then never actually getting to the art).

Honestly this is the best app I’ve ever paid money for (and one of the very few I shelled out cash for period), and it’s been completely worth it.  If you spend upwards of 4 hours a day on your phone (like I was doing), I highly recommend taking this app into consideration!",

A couple of requests: I would love more kinds of ambient sounds to be added to the ""store."" Also, please create a version for Mac desktop to keep us chronic procrastinators from using distracting apps and websites there! I know that a basic version of Forest exists as a Chrome extension, but it lacks a lot of my favorite features from the app, and doesn't currently block distracting desktop apps. I'm not such a fan of Chrome, anyway (I prefer Safari). In any case, keep up the fantastic work! Oh! And go check out the SleepTown  app by the same developer.

Very Good App but with a very annoying flaw,4,2021-09-16 19:00:19,False,Aye.en.dee.why,"The app is great for what it does. It’s not too complex, but just has enough fun functionality to keep you motivated and involved. You might not like these kinds of gamified time trackers if the game part isn’t attractive to you (aka you don’t like growing trees or raising an RPG character), but for everyone else they should like this. 

There is only one very very annoying flaw. There is no landscape mode, at least not on tablets. People have been asking for this for a while now and it still hasn’t happened. I understand why they’d hold off on making it initially but with the release of the Magic Keyboard (which is now gen 2) that puts iPads in landscape, they should have developed this by now. Essentially it’s their way of saying only use this app on your phone.  Also it’s not a bad web plugin but I don’t really find it that useful. Maybe if your workflow lived entirely in a browser, it’d be more helpful.

This isn’t to be a downer though. It’s a very good app, it just has some flaws that are puzzling at best and keep it from being really great",
i like it a lot,4,2021-05-09 04:25:47,False,ejshcs,"To be honest, I really like this app. I think it’s super helpful, and super beautiful. I really like the grid layout and all of that. My only complaint is that I think that although the developers know this already, it is silly that there’s a limit on how many real tress you can plant through the app. my biggest complaint however is not necessarily with just this app but also similar apps that reward you for focusing which is that they don’t really get of a full Pomodoro experience, i.e. letting you set up multiple cycles of 25 minutes of focus and 5 minutes of break. Instead, you have to open up the app every time you finish your focus session and click to set a timer for the break and go back to the app after the break to start the focus timer again. Of course, this isn’t a dealbreaker on the app for me, it just means after that five minute break I will often get distracted and forget to come back to the app. Other than that I think it’s a great app and adding the classic Pomodoro experience would push this app to five stars for me.",

I needed something to take my Sleaze level way down from Super Saiyan Sleaze God to, like, just a regular Super Saiyan Sleaze. 

One day, during my procrastination addiction, I was looking though some apps and I saw it: Forest-Stay Focused. I immediately felt drawn. “I’ll just keep procrastinating and sleazing it up while I check out this app,” I thought. Unbeknownst to my Sleazy Habits, this app would soon become the death them. I use it all the time and have gone from not studying or doing homework at all, to working on homework and studying for over 3 solid hours a day (and growing! As is my forest!). This app is awesome, and I can actually feel my Super Saiyan Sleaze Power leave me. Best $2 I ever spent.

Where did my coins go???,4,2019-03-28 22:48:40,False,Angelacast387,"I was 1 coin away from having 900 coins, enough to buy a new tree and I was very excited. I planted a bush for 10 minutes and now I’m at 867?? You can only imagine my disappointment. Is it charging me to plant trees? If so, then it’s a dumb feature and just makes me want to stop using the app. If it was a bug on your part, then I want my coins back 😡 I worked hard for those. They’re not easy to accumulate. 

But overall, I’m giving this app 4 stars (5 if I get my coins back). When I was referred by a friend I thought it was silly but it’s literally the only thing that keeps from using my phone when studying. You’d think planting fake trees (you can also save up to plant a real tree) wouldn’t be motivation enough but it is!!! If you convince your friends to buy this app, you can create a room and study together and hold each other accountable! My friends and I compare the trees we have and are always eager to expand our forest. Great app! Just give me coins back 😫.

Fantastic!,5,2017-12-17 20:36:52,False,w0zbunny,"This app has truly assisted me in staying focused on all my homework that i’m getting as i’ve got a lot going on between ap classes, music dedications & the track season coming up. i’ve always had a really bad habit of playing on my phone instead of completing the assignments i should. it’s caused me to loose a lot of sleep and this app has definitely helped with that. overall i totally recommend this app for anyone who has that annoying habit to procrastinate when you shouldn’t. 

on a side note though my friends and i typically converse about homework and check our answers with one another trough texting and after i’ve planted a tree i cannot respond back, which is the whole point, but id like to see a way i could pause the growth of my tree for say 5 minutes to allow myself to review the information that’s being passed on to me. it kinda goes against what this app is for but i feel it would be beneficial especially for students who regularly converse over their assignments",
"Fun and works, but needs more features",4,2020-08-10 21:54:22,False,Nouveau_Riche,"So far I’m actively using it and having fun with it. I do feel more rewarded and accomplished when I finish a task which makes studying more fun and working from home less of a chore. It was definitely worth the $2! I think a reading feature would help though, especially for studying. It operates strictly on a timer, but say you need to read two chapters before tomorrow. It’s really hard to tell how long that will take. If you take to the material easily, it won’t take nearly as long as you expected to finish but if you stop the timer early you don’t get rewarded. So a checklist or task feature that maybe worked it conjunction with the timer would be better, something where you could mark a task as completed without being pinged because you got it done quicker than you thought. This could also work well if you’re trying to get chores done without getting distracted. Right now, this is better for work or sleep when you know you’re only going to be doing it for a set amount of time.",

I did longer trees and it helped me get off my phone for the whole night! The app makes you plant a tree, and you can’t exit the app for however long you set it. If you finish planting the tree, it goes in your forest. However, if you leave the app, the tree withers and shows up on your forest as well. You can use this with friends, coop, and gain coins for ever tree planted and achievement completed. Not only that, it is a relaxing app that has a selection of calming music(beach sounds, forest, etc). I believe the reason that this work is psychology. It makes you want to finish the tree and get coins, any brag you your friends about how many trees you planted. It puts pressure on you to not give up which I think is genius.

Even if I’m not being productive, I’m still working on something when I use it. I love how you can cancel a tree without killing it for the first 10 seconds after planting one, but I really wish that time was longer for bigger trees. It would be pretty helpful.
      The biggest moment for me was when it came time for me to kill my first tree. I really didn’t want to kill it, but I hadn’t been working. If I hadn’t chopped it down, it would’ve opened the floodgates for me. The main difficulty for me is starting to grow my tree. If I don’t start it, I don’t have to be productive.
      I’ve had this app for under a month and I’ve already recommended it to a few people, who have all said it was really helpful.

Excellent app,4,2020-12-29 13:07:29,False,hijgkfmdkfnfkdnekfj,"This app is really good. I’m a student who uses my phone way too much and this app has both made me aware of that and helped me spend less time on my phone. It takes a while to get new trees but I don’t even care because you start out with 2 or 3 anyway. I like to use different types of trees for different activities. 
As someone who enjoys nature but doesn’t have much opportunity to be in it, I’m very drawn to the forest aspect. I also like how you can see your forest for the day, week, month, or year. 
My ONE suggestion so far would be to have a feature that counts up instead of down; either that or a way to continue the same tree immediately after the timer goes off assuming you’re still focusing. If I’m focusing on reading I don’t always know how long it will take so if I set it for 25min and read for 45, I’d rather just extend the tree than have multiple smaller ones.

And then also to be able to save these task names on a list if such a storyboarding project is going to take me numerous planting sessions, so that I can just select it from a list instead of typing it ever time.

I mean is that seriously the most demanded feature? I’ve been trying to incorporate regular breaks into my continuous work sessions by running a pomodoro app together with the Forest app for ages, which has been super inefficient, and I’m sure I’m not alone. Maybe you can set an allowance of max of 5-minute break every 30min. You can choose how often you break with total amount of break time as constraint. Say you are planting for 2h, giving you a max break allowance of 20min. You can choose the traditional pomodoro method of breaking for 5 every 25min, or you can choose to work 1h and 40min and take 20. But seriously regular breaks are so essential for concentration and I just think missing that feature is a big flaw in an app that aims to improve concentration and productivity.",
A pleasurable experience,4,2020-03-03 15:50:25,False,DustyTrilby,"I have picked up forest a few times through the years as a means to re-train myself to be focused.

The premise is simple: you are betting against yourself. Accessing your phone costs you a beautiful little tree in your forest. It is also kind of fun like a game, ""how can I shape my forest?"" So, you have many motivations to not access your phone. At the end of the day, you see your forest with few (or preferably no) dead trees and you can say, ""I did a good job today.""

The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is the inherent limitations of such an app: it cannot differentiate between uses of the phone. For example, if I need to access my photos because I took a photo of a whiteboard in a meeting, I can't until the focus period ends. There is a mode that let's you cheat, but that defeats the purpose of the app. There is no solution to this, as that would defeat privacy measures in the phone.

So as soon as I got a device capable of installing the app again, I did! There is just something so rewarding about growing a tree while doing something I actually need to do. I have been known to turn it on in serious study mode or when out with friends so I can really be in the moment.

Since the last time I used this, they have added some new capabilities. You can tag trees to say what you were doing while growing your tree. You can use the app with your friends to really make your group focus or actually spend time with each other. And, one of my favorites, you can use the virtual coins you earn from growing trees to plant a tree in real life.

If I have one criticism, it is that they set point values for new trees and real trees entirely too high. It is very hard to raise enough coins to unlock even one new tree type let alone get the funds to plant a tree in real life!","{'id': 5067138, 'body': 'Hello,\n\nCurrently, the first tree species purchase will cost 500 coins.

BEST INVESTMENT EVER OMG,5,2021-04-23 00:04:31,False,JustARandomCatlover,"I hardly ever write reviews for apps, but I seriously LOVE forest! The whole app is very intuitive and they seem to be very invested in making sure the customer actually enjoys the product. They’re also always releasing new features so if you’re super ambitious and have bought all the trees, there will always be new options for you. 

I have two absolute favorite features. One is the break timer—you set it for a few minutes, and then it sends you a notification reminder when it’s time to start working again. It’s like a customizable form of the pomodoro method because unlike other apps you can choose exactly how long you want different intervals to be. 

The other feature which was just introduced recently is the stopwatch feature! My issue with selecting a time beforehand was that I didn’t know how long a particular task was going to take, and I prefer to do large chunks all at once. This way, I can do the hard part of starting a task and putting down my phone without having to fit my tasks into pre determined increments. 

Some people might just pick up their phone again right after the initial required 10 minutes have passed, but i feel like this feature allows me to work more because I don’t feel like I’m making a huge commitment to not touch my phone for 45 minutes.

Here’s my problem - I’ve unlocked almost everything except for a couple trees I really don’t like.  While I could just keep growing different combinations of trees and bushes, what I really wish I could do is to add forest animals. 

I’d like to be able to earn various forest animals to my existing forests, or maybe start with the animals some times and then add the trees, or add a couple trees and sprinkle animals in. For the shorter time frames smaller animals like birds, butterflies, bunnies, lizards, squirrels, bats, etc. and for the longer time animals like deer, elk, wild pigs, and other regular animals found in the forest. I think the animal options here are endless and also would really make the forests look cool.  The animals would just “grow” exactly like the trees and bushes do.  The animals should match the various kinds of trees that are available. Some regular, some tropical (for palm tree), etc. 

Any chance of animals coming soon?

Also the smaller animals should cost less coins and the bigger ones more coins. I find it annoying that currently the bushes cost the same as the trees. They are smaller and therefore shouldn’t cost the same as the larger trees.",
Not for me,3,2019-10-27 13:09:15,False,Bobsamurai,"I feel like this is a concentration tracking app more than a productivity app. You plant a tree for every task you wish to concentrate on and if you break your focus (leave the app) the tree will wither. The problem here is that I need to concentrate on work, to work I need to use my phone. This app allows you to create a white list of apps that are required for your task, however this feature is not available in IOS devices. This renders the app to be nothing more than a tea timer and a graph depicting how many times you set the tea timer. You are allowed to create your own tags, but you can’t assign a task to your session until after the session is over, this means that if you read a book 7 days in a row you plant 7 trees instead of continue to water the same tree to keep it alive. I only bought this to be a visualization of my consistency with the various aspects of my life, but the app doesn’t work this way. I don’t see why this app isn’t free with ads considering that one of its most important features does not work on iPhones.",

Then you need this app. Before I bought this app I had “D-‘s”and “F’s” in all my classes. Everytime I Would get home from highschool I would immediately go on social media. But with Forest my life is completely different. I now have “A’s”In almost all my classes and if not an “A” the a “B+”. When you sign up into Forest you are greeted with 2 trees that you can plant and then unlimited other trees that are so many cute designs.

Love the aspect of unlocking trees, just worried about whenever I unlock them all; if the app creators can make some sort of consistent and ever-expanding progression system where you always have motivations to keep gathering the coins it’d be 5 starts for me! Given that they occasionally add trees, I think they’re getting there — could definitely improve the sounds/atmosphere music offered for purchase and maybe more purchases or aspects could be added later? This is all just nitpicking though, currently I’m quite happy and highly recommend the app!

Edit: A simple addition would be a way to batch edit tags; it’s a simple fix, but would improve user interface as I create tags for classes and different aspects of projects; once a project or semester is done though, it’s tedious to individually delete — and I’m sure other people rotate through different tags as well :)",

I think the features it has is cool, too. There are different settings for the background noise and they start you out with rainfall outside a window. (You have to “earn” the others with the coins you make). Another feature I thought is helpful is the ‘deep focus’ setting that you can put the app on and if you leave the app, then your tree or bush withers and dies. It kind of forces you to put down your phone or else the thing that shows that you’ve done your work is gone.
I like being able to label the trees or bushes with the task I completed as well. My forest is growing!
The only thing I don’t like as much is how you have to wait for a long time to unlock a different type of bush or tree. It’ll probably take a week to two weeks of like, an hour in order to unlock a new tree. :/

Great Concept & Motivation for Studying,5,2022-09-18 19:42:40,False,Brnd26,"It’s a huge plus that there’s a humanitarian and ecologically motivating factor for diving into productivity. I’ve perpetually avoided school work (among many other less than desirable responsibilities) for years and I’ve tried countless things to help keep me on track and focused. Along with other self-care tips like creating a relaxing setting for studying, proper breathing, getting up and moving, meditation, vitamins and eating/sleeping right This app is the icing on the cake. I can bring a more creative/optimistic outlook on studying. 

Also, for student that don’t know what the Pomodoro technique is - it really works!! If you’re a student and haven’t tried to, give it a shot. The technique is setting a timer for 25 minuets studying/reading/working & 5 minuets off. Personally I found that taking two 5 minuet breaks every two sessions and then one 15 minuet break after the third round is my sweet spot. There’s plenty of research to back up the technique if you’re interested in it :)

For App Developers: 

Please bring this app to full timer control/functionality on the Apple Watch!! A lot of students are looking to completely get away from their phones while studying (at least I am). Other than that amazing job on the app, will be by go-to every time I need to crack down on some productivity :)",

My one suggestion would be to offer an option where a timer for focusing can be started and run for as long as focusing lasts, rather than requiring the user to specify a time period. Sometimes I’m not sure how long I’m going to be able to focus before I’m interrupted (e.g. my son running into the room needing something, a call coming in that I can’t dismiss), and it sometimes discourages me from planting if I’m worried I can’t determine how long I’ll be able to stay focused and don’t want a dead tree on my hands. Sometimes the break in focus is outside of your control, and I think this would be a good feature along with the timer option currently available to ensure that users can track how long they’re able to focus without interruptions.",

This app does an amazing job at encouraging me to not only stay off of social media apps, but to actually want to use this app to rack up coins and study time. You get coins for using the timer, and once you finish, you can spend them in the virtual store. It’s so satisfying to be able to earn new study sounds and/or trees to plant. Ah- forgot about that. While you focus, a virtual tree is planted and grows until you finish. It’s then added to your personal virtual garden- and I make a daily goal to make it as pretty as possible!

This app wards off distractions and is a perfect way to keep yourself focused! 
The in-app purchases are not at all necessary (I haven’t felt even the slightest bit tempted to spend money), so you should definitely give this app a try! 

Here’s the longer explanation:

I originally heard about Forest from a friend after I told her how I was struggling to avoid getting distracted. It seemed like every time I tried to sit down and start working, a new notification popped up on my screen- whether it was a text message, an email, or a game alert- and I couldn’t stay focused.

I love this app because it helps me stay on track and get work done. With the adorable game design aside, using this app is just super gratifying! Of course, the tiny trees are cute and it’s fun to grow your own forest, but this app isn’t just aesthetically pleasing: it’s extremely functional. It allows me to focus, avoid distractions, and succeed in school. 

There’s nothing you need to buy in order to use the app, so just download it and give it a try! If it doesn’t work for you, then you can just delete it, but it might end up being super useful for you, just as it was for me!",

I’m in love with the concept of planting real trees in favor of more time connected to nature and each other. 🌳❤️ I’ve used it for years to keep myself off of my phone and stop myself from doom scrolling! I had a terrible habit of this, but this app has been a HUGE help to slowing this habit! 5/5 - I always recommend to my friends and family!

I love the different trees and the different goals. The only feature that I really wish they would develop further is its social features. I have several friends who use the app, and we’ve added each other, but all I can see from them is their history from just ONE day. I wish the friends leaderboard would be weekly instead of daily, and that there were more social features: maybe permanent groups you could create and see if everyone was focused together (imagine how school teachers could utilize that!) or who had the most minutes that week in a particular group. All in all, amazing app, I would just use it so much more if more social features were added.",
Motivation,5,2019-01-29 04:15:27,False,DealzYo,"This app has been great for keeping me on track with my studies. Getting a tree to put in your forest gives me just a little extra nudge to do my work uninterrupted. Where I used to easily get sidetracked, there is just something about having that tree growing that stops me if I want to google some random fact or click on a news article. Even though the app is on my phone (so my computer is still available), I have no desire to “cheat”. What is the point in a forest full of trees you didn’t earn?

One overall suggestion I will make is that the sky is the limit with an app like this. How about a building? A town? A farm? An amusement park? There is definitely a lot of potential here if a talented group of programers want to expand on this whole idea.

For immediate improvements I would like more it the shop. I have a feeling that will keep coming though.",
My Favorite App!,5,2018-07-08 04:35:13,False,Rosie015,"Forest has made a hugely positive impact on my studies and productivity. The main focus of this app is to stop you from getting distracted, which is already amazing on its own. However, there are also other great things about it. It MOTIVATES me to study because the ability to view how many minutes of work I did in a day/week makes me feel so happy and proud of myself, and it encourages me to plant more and more trees. It also encourages me to continue studying even when the timer is done since you can get more coins. Being able to study with friends is really fun, too! The different trees/bushes you can buy with coins you earn from focusing are all super cute as well. Lastly, I LOVE the idea of being able to plant a REAL tree!

Great- Could be better,4,2021-01-06 22:53:49,False,Shalomgracelove,"This app is amazing. Really gives me motivation to follow through with my to do list. I pair this app with their other one, Sleeptown. I love that one too so far. And a to-do list app by someone else “To Do Adventure”

There’s only a few trees you can start out with... And the rest you have to save up coins for which is great incentive but it also takes a ton more saving than I would expect. It’s because you can also buy coins, which I wouldn’t expect from an app you already are paying for upfront. I thought the in-app purchases would be donations going towards planting irl trees. So that’s disappointing. 

The forest also resets everyday so your trees disappear, instead of building one huge forest over time, which is saddening. But the incentive still works because I don’t want the tree to wilt and I at least want to build up a nice little for the day.",
Effective but can be improved,3,2019-05-15 15:32:47,False,All_Usernames_Basically_Taken,"I’ve been using the app for a few years and love how it motivates me to stay on task. That said, I think it’s time for this app to do far more to really facilitate better focus.

The Pomodoro Technique is effective for a lot of people because you can move between productive time and small breaks. The way this app works, however, is that if you want to plant a tree to its full size you need to focus for two hours straight otherwise it dies or you get a small, not as cute looking tree stub. Frankly, I don’t know anyone nowadays who does that. That’s 1/12 of the whole day already. As a student, I need breaks like most people do. Other productivity apps have this option and I think the devs should consider incorporating a Pomodoro Technique option when you decide to focus for longer than 25 minutes.

This is frustrating because I slaved away to earn 1000 coins on buying a cute tree that I can’t focus long enough for. To contextualize, you get 5-6 coins per 20min study and the number of coins earned increases the longer you study in one session. You can imagine how many hours I spent with this app to buy a few trees. These days though, the shrubs are clearly more valuable because the focus-time for those is 20 min at most. 

Please consider incorporating a Pomodoro Technique mechanic.

Great app!,5,2019-04-07 18:36:35,False,Apostate_Mage,"I have ADHD and this app has been incredibly helpful! It’s greatly improved my ability to stay on task and off my phone.

My biggest problem when working is I don’t realize I’ve gotten distracted. Before it was easy to just pick up my phone and spend hours not doing anything.

Now when I pick up my phone I see the forest app I realize I’m distracted. It’s an amazing mental stop and is usually enough to get me to go back on task. 

If not the little trees are cute and I know it sounds silly but I don’t want to kill a tree to check reddit. If you do kill a tree it also will put a dead tree in your forest. 

You can also unlock new trees with coins. You get coins by putting more trees in your forest so it’s kinda a motivational thing to focus more to unlock more trees. (You can also unlock sounds to listen to while you focus.) 

The app is a great tool for anyone who gets mindlessly distracted and doesn’t realize. It’ll keep your phone from being a distraction point at a minimum. (It’s not magic unfortunately and won’t stop other distractions).

If you’re the kinda person who deliberately procrastinates or realizes that you are distracted it may or may not help. It depends how much you can bring yourself to care about the app.

My friends who are with me in body appreciate it. My friends and family in mind who text me do not. I'm okay with that. I've read four books this month and been more efficient at life.

I would like to see some upgrades such as an option to save different tree types as labeled for different activities (cherry blossom for studying, birdhouse for cleaning...etc.) and seeing a large grid of all trees ever with a zoom function.

Well, I find that timing myself  gets and keeps me in the mood to get my school work done as well as manage how much of each class I do. It keeps track you your progress and depending on what tags you use, it can also show you what you study the most. Also I really like nature and I’m so down to plant a tree to keep me focused. Though, if there is one improvement I would want in the app, it would be that you get more money the longer you study. Like a significant amount more.

I spend most of my time on this thing procrastinating (like how I’m writing this now instead of writing a paper...) and Forest is amazing at helping me control that. I like planting little trees in my forest and being able to plant real ones too! The only thing I would change, is being able to design your own forest. The way it’s laid out is good, but it would be nice if like in SleepTown, you could customize a little forest using your existing array of trees and maybe buy little decorations, because looking at over 800 little trees at once is kinda overwhelming, and you have to go into months or weeks to actually see them.

My one complaint is how sparse the interface and “forest-view” are. . . This is the only reason I’ve taken off a star. It’s a free app; I get that. However, there are optional in-app purchases—-it seems to me that it would be worth it to the developers to put a “prettier” pic in background while growing my tree and a MUCH nicer view of my forest. I’d pay a little for this if they did it (for sure) and/or perhaps they could implement better/different in-app purchases to support such an overhaul. Anyway, would be truly my fav productivity app, and never would I stray, would they work on these aesthetics!! In the meantime, though, I’m sure I’ll continue to use this pleasing little app :)",
Decrease in Quality Recently & Counterproductive Chrome-to-iOS Sync Issues,2,2020-05-02 20:39:03,False,maryeliz62442,"PROBLEM: You must improve Chrome-to-app syncing so that we can use and reap the gold rewards for using the chrome extension on multiple devices AND this app on multiple devices. Currently, users are punished (by losing gold) when they run the extension and app simultaneously. For an app rated at #2 in productivity, this seems counterproductive.

TIMELINE: This has been an issue for over a year now (there is a Chrome extension complaint about this from Feb 2019). We paid for this app. That means you have the funds to dedicate resources to improving the Forest application. 

SOLUTION: If you’re worried about players getting gold too quickly by using multiple devices, then input an algorithm that first recognizes when multiple decides are running a session simultaneously. If a user has only one device, then they earn gold normally, with no change to the rate. The gold earned from any simultaneously-running extra devices (eg extensions or app) should be at a lesser rate.

I’ve used this app for over a year now, and it’s been good for the most part. However, the Forest app developers need to get it together. For a paid app, I expect better.

PROBLEM: App developers have ceased giving users motivators for lengthier sessions. All the new trees have just one stage for all session lengths. That’s laziness. 

SOLUTION: Make multiple stages for new trees.

Great app but there are some issues,5,2019-11-08 01:24:00,False,Tea bear:),"I personally enjoy this application quite a lot. There are of course a few issues with it. One I would like to focus on being, I personally prefer the “deep focus” setting which will kill your tree if you exit the app, but the problem is if there is something you need to check on your phone or if you need to look something up you cannot so simply do it. now, I am sure there is a way to prevent this but it is not immediately clear. My second point relates to my last. While the app is simple looking, looks can be deceiving and takes a bit to get used to. It is by far the most helpful tool in time management that I have and for that I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone looking for a better way to focus without the distraction of technology",
Great way to focus and get stuff done,5,2019-05-28 13:13:01,False,FlynWaldo,"Its a great app if you need to get anything done, work, sleep, or just can’t put down your phone, it works very well. Seeing the amount of trees you’ve grown over the month is very satisfying and actually quite difficult/heartbreaking to kill trees, I haven’t killed one yet. A few notes though: there isn’t a way to end a timer if you got all your work done, meaning even if you have everything done, you still have to either wait for the tree, or kill the tree. I wish there was a good way to get the work done, maybe change it for a different tree, but something so you don’t have to kill the tree but don’t have to wait 20 minutes.

A few quick things about the app;

Parents:
This is not a good way to make your child get work done as they still have the choice to get out and will get out if this is against their will. I am not a condoner of things like OurPact, there are better ways to control your child and let them get their work done

Students/anyone else:
This app is a great way to stay encouraged and not have the distraction of your own phone, I count computer games as killing the tree though, so you set your own rules and get down to getting your work done!

I wish you the best of luck!",

I have OCD so looking at those dead trees would make me uncomfortable and angry. I think the various different trees are super cool, and I love that some plants have different levels, so the longer you stay focused the more “upgraded” it gets and makes it look cool. I especially love being able to view all the trees and plants I have grown in my forest. The sounds are really calming as well.

Easy to Use Incentive & Tracking,5,2019-04-18 12:10:57,False,ary14DR,"I love Forest. I started using it about 1 year ago to help decrease my screen time and, most usefully, to track my focused time working. I find it especially helpful for tracking writing time. The act of planting a tree adds an element of habit that helps me focus.

I don’t really participate in the community there or competition, but I have planted with friends. I find it a bit clunky in that regard because we often have to enter the codes manually to join a room or do so from email. One time I was able to just click an invite in the app. I think you have to have the plant with friends screen open for that to happen and that timing is rare for my slightly scattered friend and I.

The idea of having a visual outcome of a virtual forest to show a productive day sounded great.  The issue is, while you can certainly set the timer to 25 min blocks of time, this means you can only get the less ornamental (just above the base-model/bush) version of trees since the fanciest versions require setting the timer to longer stretches of time.  Over time, this has led to me having to use a second timer to break down a 2 hour block into the 25 min/5 min Pomodoro segments, which ultimately shows the app’s limited usefulness as a fun, standalone task timer. As a result, my use of the app has gradually fallen off (still trying though). One thing that revived my interest was the  developers putting holiday themes for the trees/bushes in December.

My only complaint is with the forest aspect. My forest is not very aesthetically pleasing because there is no option to rearrange your plants or trees.

1. It would be really nice to be able to pause a tree. For example, if you were planting a tree at work, but then needed to step away from your desk for a few minutes to help a coworker or something, it would be really nice to be able to pause the tree and then come back and restart it. Otherwise, you either have to kill it, or just let it grow - but letting it grow isn’t a truthful measure of your focus time. 

2. I think the “Plant Together” feature could be updated. It would be nice if friends could plant a forest in a room together, but not be constrained by the planting time of the other person. For instance, if my friend and I started a forest for the day, it would be nice to independently add to it at the same time with different trees and different lengths of study times.

some features i wish were included would be the ability to add a tree/chunk of time for the times i do work and forget to set the timer. id also like to be able to set a stopwatch without an ending because sometimes i want to keep working past the original time set. it’s annoying to have to pick it up and set an extra 10-15 minutes. at the same time, sometimes i’ll finish my work sooner than when the timer goes off, and then i need to kill the tree i’m currently growing or just let the timer finish, but then my times are slightly inaccurate. i know this is nitpicky, but it’s just some features i’ve used with other apps that i really enjoyed. i will continue to use this app regardless because i like their commitment to helping the environment and i think the forests are cute ways of tracking time spent.",

Now it only gives you coins based on your set time. The drawback to this is that you have to repeatedly go back and set a new goal once the time is up if you want to be rewarded. That means being distracted by having to reach your phone. Overall, a useful app, just a little less than before.","{'id': 1907283, 'body': 'Hello,\nWe would suggest you to go to settings and switch on ""counting exceeded time"".

Good! But I’d like an Autoversion,5,2021-05-08 21:40:22,False,Tinydrago,"The app is good at helping me keep track of the number of hours I work on art and teaches me to take periodic breaks for my own health. In that respect it’s successful. And it even has a pledge to plant trees. That’s always fun. You can look back on your productivity and keep track of how ""good"" you were that week.

I’d be interested in a version of this app that works automatically, though. Like you set up a date and times when you intend to be productive the following day, and if you don’t make it to those things you promised yourself, it keeps a record by showing you how many trees you ""could have planted"" if you had been on time. Like maybe some transparent trees in your forest. Just a thought!",
Best Productivity App Ever!,5,2019-11-24 21:28:56,False,SpiffyCheese,"I very rarely spend money on virtual things, but this app is definitely worth the $2. I have never been this productive in my life. The sheer quality of this app is amazing. Forest has a beautiful Graphical User Interface. I end up spending the most time on my phone using this app, if you don’t count Safari and Messages. Forest has a feature that displays a graph that implicates your productivity throughout the day. The feature that breaks down how much time you spend on individual activities is also quite useful and interesting. It’s genuinely a great app.

My only complaint is that you cannot rearrange the order of your tags, or the order that they show up in the pie graph. Also the Time Line tab is a bit useless. Other then that, this app is perfect.",
Focus for a good cause,5,2019-10-01 22:55:47,False,Unicornuucopia,"This app has been a helpful asset to building better habits in my life. Sometimes I use it as a timer/ dare to get stuff done , e.g. “I have two tasks to do, I’m going to see if I can get them done in 30 minutes.” It takes personal work to build habits and work ethic, and this app acts as a good support of that. When I first bought the app I was studying for the GRE, by the time I collected enough seeds to plant a real tree outside of the app, I was one year into graduate school and that was a pretty cool moment. (I definitely would have accumulated enough hours work before that if I used the app EVERY time I did work or studied)
I recommend this to my friends and family! We need more trees in the world, more time applying ourselves to meaningful work, (and less time on our cellphones.)",
My productivity has grown,5,2019-08-06 16:00:19,False,Schnoodle1010,"I usually don’t buy apps, but this one is worth it!

I love the little trees you can see that you’ve built over time, and that eventually you can build a real life tree!

The only criticism I have is that I think it takes way too many coins to buy new digital trees or a real one. I understand it’s expensive to plant a new tree and they make money by people buying things to make them get more digital currency, but it seems hard to set your goals to plant a real life when the goals seem unattainable. 

Regardless, this is definitely the best productivity app I’ve used! Worth the $2!",

No matter what you do, you can’t seem to go more than a few minutes without using your phone to browse social media, text friends, etc. Even the most urgent tasks get put to the wayside so you can give your phone all of your attention. This app has done wonders for me. Having that immediate reminder upon opening my phone that I need to keep this tree alive and well forces me to put my phone down and get right back to work. Additionally, by using the Pomodoro method along with this app, I’ve managed to be more productive and satisfied than ever before. This app is must have for everyone!!",

Mentally it can be very hard to break that habit, and sometimes I’m not even anxious, I just get distracted.  This app plays so well on how humans bond to things.  If you’re anything like me, the adorable plants you grow will quickly become your little buddies and you’ll want to avoid killing them, which makes it so much easier for me to just leave the app open as the timer counts down.  If you find yourself bonding with small things like stuffed animals or a rock that looks interesting, I highly recommend this app for when you need to stop playing on your phone for a little while!",

It gives you a visual representation of what you are achieving inside when you focus and study. For me it’s hard to justify studying even though I know it’s good for me, but seeing a little forest starting reminds me that my brain and discipline is also growing. I like the idea of seasonal challenges too it kind of reminds me of animal crossing. It would be cool to eventually see animals, pets introduced that could live in the forest and grow as you log more time. Super cool!

$2 for this type of productivity is worth it,5,2019-09-13 05:16:41,False,admreviews,"Love the app. 

The Home Forest screen is good. Only thing I would change is I’d like the ability to edit my own forest/garden. Almost like a game appeal so that it’s a bit more fun. You can still do everything you’re doing (because I like seeing my productivity) and add this feature as another tab after “year” if you catch what I’m putting down

The timeline is super cute and I like the fact that I can see a detailed view because I’ve tagged my tree to what I’m doing. 

I love that I can see my friends but I hate that I can only see what they’ve been doing on that day only. Again I’d love for everyone to be able to edit their forests and for their friends to view it too. 

Achievements are cool, I haven’t unlocked any yet. It’s only my 2nd day out here 

The inventory in the store is selective and I love the choice of trees. I’d add more sound choices and I think bushes should be worth less than trees lol

It’s so cool you can actually help plant real trees with the coins you built up in the game! 

The news tab is well organized and appealing to look at. Everything about this app has a very “fun” appeal, it’s easy to use and it all ties together ☺️",
This app is charging my life,5,2018-06-02 03:26:53,False,Kittykat710,"First, I would like to say thank you to the creators of Forest. I am a highly distractible person, and my life has been a battle for focus (often a losing one). I honestly didn’t think this app was going to work so well. I’ve tried many techniques to attempt to focus, including the Pomodoro technique that this app employs, but have never been successful. Forest is the perfect blend of Pomodoro timer + game.

The reason it works so well for me is that I love trees and flowers. Thus, it provides me a reward that I actually want, that convinces me to not just give up and let the tree die in order to indulge my Pinterest addiction. I have a feeling that if wanting to “grow a forest” isn’t something that interests you, this may not work as well. It does help that you have the opportunity to grow real trees, thus adding an altruistic reason to succeed in focusing.

Forest is also simple to use, has adorable art, and sports a decent selection of trees and bushes to work toward for continued motivation to use the app. I hope they continue to add new types of flora as once I “complete” the game aspect of this app I may not feel as compelled to use it. 

All in all, an elegant solution to phone obsession.",

Being a college student with ADHD, this app has helped me so much because there are times where I can get distracted by Instagram or FB for hours. I love the concept of planting trees and being able to see how much you’ve stayed focus for a day, week, month, or year. I also love that you have the ability to help plant a real tree. That being said, I do wish I was able to see the timer on my lock screen, so that by just turning on my phone I would be able to see the time left. I usually leave my phone on silent or do not disturb while studying, so I don’t get the notification that my tree has been planted.",
As Effective as You Are Honest With It,5,2019-04-14 02:49:14,False,Daeryu,"Forest has been a good tool for preserving both my productivity and phone battery. The pie chart it provides (after you tag each session with a category) also helps break down where your time on Forest is going. 

As a more competitive person, having a ranking system between my friends and I is helpful. Having more trees and bushes is something I enjoy looking forward to; the last update was a fun experience. While I understand the idea of an increasing 100 coin cost with each tree bought, I found myself taking a mental L after prices started going beyond 1000.

Otherwise animated trees. That’d be amazing, and I wouldn’t mind earning a ton for coins for those.

Something that might be fun to see in the future are personal challenges. I enjoy the achievements and their rewards offered by the app (i.e. X consecutive days rewards and X many days’ worth of focus time for coins), and it would be nice to see more of them. Reward variety in the form of exclusive trees/bushes or planting actual trees is also something that’d be cool to have.

TL;DR: effective app. More trees (animated trees? ✨) and bushes to purchase/earn and more achievements with rewards would be cool.",
WORTH THE PURCHASE :),5,2019-10-17 11:22:05,False,Atrtvyttcuhw,"really helps me get my work done, a YouTuber who made a video on time management recommended this app to me. I decided to check it out.

It works, it’s worth the $1.99 purchase for all the work you will get done. 9/10 recommend. 

SUGGESTION: please make it to where if you use certain apps during your work time, your tree dies. I saw this because there are certain apps on my phone I use to help me with homework, but I cannot use them while in “focus mode” if there was another mode that allowed you to ONLY USE educational apps and if you use SOCIAL app your tree dies.

Changed The Way I Spend My Day!,5,2018-02-04 18:53:34,False,Makhailla Morris,"I’m very easily distracted, a habitual phone checker and struggle with my ability to focus. I used to pick my phone up every 2 minutes, even less, just clicking the phone screen to see if anything new had happened or just to check the time (even if I jut checked 45 seconds ago). 

When I downloaded Forest, it took some time for me to actually get the ball rolling and utilising it as much as I can. 

I love knowing how I spend the minutes in my day. I love the productivity I feel when I’m in a flow state and am not distracted by a cellphone going off, I love how much work I get done when I’m not spending one minute refreshing all my apps for every five minutes I’m working on something. 

I use it to time things I hate doing, like the dishes or studying or mopping. I use it for things I love, like yoga, running and reading. 

Plus, every few minutes I spend allows me to receive a coin, which will eventually build up until I’m able to plant a REAL tree. This inspires and drives me to spend mindful minutes in order to have the reward of doing something good. 

All in all, I LOVE Forest. 

I do wish we could customise our dashboard, though.

These guys give you such incentives with in app rewards and real life rewards (helping save the word by planting trees!!). I 100% recommend this to anyone who is trying to put real hours in.

I’m not saying the app is a magic cure all - really, it adds a gamified framework that rewards you slightly with points when you complete your timed sessions. However, this importantly makes the act of training your mind into solid shape more focused and fun, and has helped me at least get more productive at work I found very boring at first.

It’s really easy to look back on all your different forests, and you can even connect with friends to compare, if you’re the competitive type ;^) Granted, you still need the self control to open the app and stick to it in the first place, but that’s not the app’s responsibility, haha.

I know the app is about focusing and ignoring my phone but sometimes my focus involves working on my phone and sometimes it doesn't. I know this is in my settings but it would be nice to have a toggle available to select when I start planting my tree. 2) the app works by setting a predetermined time which counts down.

So after two years, I come back and invest in this app. Sure, the ole’ planner and “hide your phone” prioritizing strategies were something. But I always knew where the phone was and my planner wasn’t getting filled consistently. When I tell you this app saved my work life.

The first day I used it, I played around with the settings and tried it without the Deep Focus. Once that seemed to do something, I grew my determination to turn it on.

I forgot to mention they also offer a program where you can spend your earned coins to have an organization plant a REAL tree. It’s a really great app. I totally recommend!!

I absolutely love this app. I’ve tried every other anti-procrastination app out there, and none have worked for until I found Forest. The fact that it still plants your dead tree makes you feel guilty because you’ll be able to see it. I feel like that’s the key right there. The saying “out of sight out of mind” really applies here. It’s NOT out of sight so it’s NOT out of mind. I really like this app, it is definitely worth the price

Also, there’s a chrome extension. You manually put in which websites you are NOT allowed to go to, so you can still use your computer for work (blacklist), or you put in the specific websites you ARE allowed to visit, and anything else will kill your tree (whitelist).

One day, you reach the fourth and penultimate stage.

HOWEVER, in all reality it’s a timer/time-tracker. There are many others out there that are equally functional yet DO NOT collect personal data. Maybe this isn’t important to you? If not, I would suggest you read about data collection to see if its something you ought to consider. Apple makes it easy to check what each app tracks and this one is a greedy little thing. 

For me, it’s a deal breaker. I had to remove it from my devices. There are other plant growing timers in the app store along with many Pomodoro type apps. I’m a student and teacher and this app has been a part of my life for years. I was disappointed to let it go. If they ever stop tracking personal data I’d be glad to return.

Forest App Review,4,2021-02-23 19:34:41,False,Lilly Grace D.,"This app is a great app for productivity, especially for students who are behind on classes and want to stop procrastinating. I think this app is definitely worth the money! There are only three changes I think could take place to make the app a 5⭐️ rating!

I think Deep Focus mode is great, but I think they could ask you for a list of allowed apps that you can use during Deep Focus Mode. I also think that they could add more free trees considering you have to pay for the app, and I think that they could add more details to trees that take a while to earn, like the 120 minute version of a tree.

Overall, I think this app is great for people who want to get off of their phone and enjoy the moment or be productive!",

Thing is, you might want to use your phone for the task you are working on. I like writing on my phone over paper and pen and even my laptop. So you can set the app to allow you to grow your tree even when you’re not in the app itself. And that’s how one could “cheat”.

Fun Incentive to Stay Focused,5,2019-04-30 20:11:54,False,dusjdoc,LOVE this app! I have ADD and tend to procrastinate the important things I need to do at work and social media is the perfect tool to do so- however this app has been super helpful with staying off of it. The premise of it may sound cheesy or like it wouldn’t be that motivating but it’s become a game for me to see how long I can stay off of it. And the fact that you get to plant real trees once you’ve earned enough coins to do so is 1. personally a good enough reason to pay for the app and 2. an even bigger motivation to stay off my phone while it’s turned on or else it’ll “kill the tree” (just on the app) that I’m in the middle of “growing.” Definitely recommend to anyone who needs help with self-discipline!,

Sometimes, you just need that little push to get yourself started on a task, and when you know that it’s not going to be endless, and that in 25 minutes or so you can take a break, it makes it seem much more doable. That’s the best way to get anything done—break it into bite-sized pieces. Sometimes, just starting a timer on Forest is enough to get me started on a task that I would not have started otherwise. Also, I like the calm ambience of the app, and the cute trees and other plants that you can earn. I also like that I can use the app on my computer as well (on Chrome). Thank you!",

Before I first started using a timer I was, in comparison to my teammates and age group (‘97 baby woot), what I thought, very productive. I don’t even remember the last time I was “late” for a deliverable or anything... I just wanted to organize my brain with a timer. 
OMG. The first day or two... phew. I felt DUMB. My total work time was maybe 2 hours. (Then I started wondering what the heck my teammates we doing all day, if they don’t even work that long, but whatever.)
Breaking everything down into tiny steps? Used to that. That’s business, baby. 
Breaking everything into 15-45 min tasks?Mind-altering. 
I usually stick to 20 or 25 with 5 min break after. That sounded counterproductive to me at first, but HA. I can genuinely say after using this app that I did not truly know what it was like to focus on one task for even 10 minutes.

Great app,4,2019-04-20 17:10:13,False,firespinner2011,I love this app! It helps me to concentrate and not mess with my phone so I can get more work done. I rated it four stars though because there’s only one thing I really wish they would improve. You earn coins for all of your successful trees grown and you can use those coins to either unlock new trees or save them up to turn them in for the app developers to play real trees in the real world. I wish you didn’t have to choose between these two. It would be cool if there were two different types of coins one to unlock trees and one to plant real trees.

I use the Pomodoro technique of 25 minutes of pure focused work and use Forest to track this.

Instead of responding in a way that told me they were working on fixing the bug, they just explained it to me as if I should work around it. 

I have dead trees on my plot because of this bug, and it made me feel crazy. 

Basically if you get an app notification and you unlock your screen with Face ID, forest falsely thinks you’ve left the app. It’ll give you a notification to go back to the app before your tree dies, but if you miss this your tree is obviously a goner. 

Not only this, the app also seems to constantly crash lately. When I look at my plot, when I open up the tree selector, etc. Support kept asking me for screen captures of this behavior even though I explained it’s inconsistent. 

As a developer I understand how important it is to capture and reproduce buggy behavior, but as a user I found the lack of listening from support to be really aggravating. In general they were unhelpful with my issues.",

It’s so very annoying and a little bit discouraging bc I would like an accurate read on my study timer.

This would allow users like me to still get rewards if they actually do spend time off of their phones but don't quite reach the set time to still accumulate ""coins"".

It’s worth every penny because you also know that your money is in good hands that are willing to help the world by planting real trees.

The cute graphics makes me motivated not to use my phone while on this app because it will kill my tree if I exit out of it.

Secondly, I wish there was a “break” option during focus sessions. I find I do well with intervals of focus and break like 20/5 minutes or 30/10.

Good for adhd,3,2019-04-22 17:56:14,False,Miss Cryptonic,"Great tool to have but you earn very little coins ex. 30 minutes = 10 coins and every time you buy a new plant/tree to grow, the more expensive the plant/trees get!

Either make it easier to get more coins with each use or don’t make them so freakin expensive.

Several things are bothersome. I’m a tablet user, and I have an attached keyboard. It is not helpful to be limited to portrait view only. That’s kind of primitive, like early 2000s. Please add landscape view.

Second, it seems counterintuitive to have a support page that requires you to scan the page you are looking at to get to FAQs. Scan with what? Another device? Why would you assume I would have two devices? I suppose I can figure out a way to screenshot and then use it to get to support, but that’s not the solution I would expect from a Stanford guy.

Also, the Contact Us link do not create an email or go to a support fill-in form. It does nothing. So, you get to read my support request here. Please fix that.

The one thing that I would suggest to the app makers would be to give an option as the free is growing to add minutes to the timer if the user decides to work longer.

It also warms my heart that being focused and planting my virtual trees allows me to plant real life trees! Amazing. Can’t say enough good stuff about this app. If your phone addiction, like mine, is so bad that you need to be forcefully kept from using your phone for no reason when you have some free time, this app is for you.

Excellent app with one minor exception,4,2019-04-11 18:21:22,False,Rupelstiltskin,"Forest is an excellent Pomodoro-style app for blocking out time for tasks. The only thing I would change about the app is to allow for time blocks below 10 minutes. Sometimes I have tasks I do not even want to spend 10 minutes on, and I think a five minute or even a one minute timer would motivate me to get those tiny tasks done. These are the kinds of tasks that do not benefit from overlearning, so setting a ten minute time on them doesn’t make sense. You might ask why set a timer for them anyway—but sometimes it’s about tricking the mind to just get started. That’s what this app is great for: tricking your mind to get stuff done.",

There IS an option to use a “take a break” after your session but it should be automatic and you should be able to set sessions with a custom amount of breaks! Minus 2 stars for that, any time management app should have it. Another gripe is that you can’t have a timer set for less than 10 minutes, which makes trying to do a work around for the pomodoro timer even harder!!!

I think the developers should reduce it to 90 minutes or even less. There should also expand the types of trees catalog and provide a brief origin for each one.

1. After I plan a type of tree, I can not change to the other. I would like to use different trees to record different activities. But when I plant wrong trees by mistake, I can not change at all. If you can let me change, it will be awesome even you ask for sunshine.

2. The trees can not be organized or move to the field I would like to plan. I understand a lots of people like trees glow as natural setting, but I would like to manage my field as a garden. It will be awesome if the developer can let me make my field be organized.

3. Do not cover the final version of two hours tree. If I plan a moon tree for 120 minutes, I definitely would like to see the bunny! So please let it show out and not be covered by the other trees or bushes I planted.

Practical. Some limitations due to iOS.,4,2020-10-08 16:39:23,False,Mosiahg,"This app is a godsend. Well... not really, but it feels better to say that than to admit “I have no discipline” or “I’m addicted to my phone.”

It is super helpful in establishing some self-parenting/boundaries with my stuff. Hopefully this has a spillover effect on my social media use.

The only complaint I have is that I can’t give certain apps permission to not interfere with the growth of my trees. That’s due to iOS and it seems like the developers are aware of the situation. I make up that the response is “that’s just the way it is, nobody likes it, but we all have to deal with it.”

The way it’s currently set up is: I either pick the Deep-Focus mode that harms my growth if I exit the app or cancel the D-F mode, which means I can go in and out of the app. Basically all-or-nothing, which blows for my particular setup because I do use some apps for legitimate work reasons. I’ll have to find a way around that for now.

The only thing i would change is how the tiles form with more trees you plant. Because the tiles keep growing at a rate higher than the amount of trees you plant, your forest is always looking emptier than it should, leaving you feeling unsatisfied.

You could make the argument that the empty tiles incentivizes the users to plant more trees, but I’d wager that users will most likely use the app longer if they’re able to consistently feel that their forest is jampacked with trees, and not sparsely potted. If you’re a designer for the app reading this, hope this influences your decision to update the algorithm for the tiles. :)",

The mornings are often when I find myself lounging around on my phone, but now I’ll wake up, send a few quick texts, lock into forest for two hours and amaze myself with how much extra I get done. It’s such a satisfying feeling to catch yourself subconsciously picking up your phone, unlocking it, and then seeing the forest app ticking away with a motivational message to get back to work.

It’s encouraging for anyone who has a tendency to stop working to look at their phone. My social media urges no longer interfere when I get done with my schoolwork. Because I’m able to set the time limit for myself, it feels very goal oriented. Best $0.99 I’ve ever spent.

Yes, I know they’re not real trees, but still, it works. 

I do not use the app in a competitive fashion, but to help me put down the iPad and get on with my life. Once I plant my tree, I often don’t pick up the iPad until well after the tree has grown, but the mere action of planting a cartoon tree in a cartoon forest helps me to put down the darned iPad!

I would love to be able to send some type of nudge to friends when I’m looking for people to start a room with.

When I was in a class is didn’t want to be in I would also plant a tree, so when I picked up my phone out of boredom and there was nothing to do on it, I would have a tree growing and that was a subtle reminder to leave my phone a lone.

Not worth it.,1,2020-10-14 07:57:12,False,Fairryyyp,"I usually never pay for apps but I thought this one would be helpful. I was wrong. I love how it plants trees in real life but it doesn’t help much with productivity. It’s mostly just a way of setting time and measuring progress. 

This app does not let me know when to stop. It is not ideal for studying. It would have been great if this app was more of a timer so I would know when to stop instead of checking my phone to know if the time is up. It can send alerts for when the tree is planted or when the time is done but so can my other apps, which is distracting. If I let this app notify me with sounds, I would also be letting other apps do the same. It would be inconvenient if I turned off notifications for other apps. 

The app has an option that prevents me from checking other apps while the time is running but the system is not ideal. I would still need to do the work; control myself. I could still open other apps but my tree would die. It would have been great if I couldn’t access non essential apps while trying to focus.

I give it 4 stars and not 5 because unless you’ve been using it for a really long time it can get kind of boring. Just because you keep planting the same tree and or bush over and over again. It takes a long time or $$$ to get something different. 

And this can make it less motivating sometimes. It would be nice to have more variety of trees and bushes available from the get go soon as you get started. 

And maybe we could add some other things too like little houses or swings and stuff and maybe people.

Review as requested by app.,3,2019-06-18 14:56:56,False,Gonzo-the-Great,"TOP LINE: Meh, so far. It looks pretty. It’s stable. It’s cheap. Poor user support and tutorial. Limited use compared to other “Pomodoro” type apps.  Buy if curious. Skip if you’re happy with your system.

PRO: the app (1) looks pretty and (2) is stable within the current version of iOS (12.x.x). (3) Reasonable one-time price for most features.

CON: (1) very weak tutorial. Much seems to be figure out as you go. (2) Poor user accessible support. Ex: App Settings -> FAQs -> blank page with spinning circle. Waited for a full minute. Still spinning. (3.) Arbitrary request for review instead of, “How are we doing?”  I’ve seen other apps, in their tutorial, mention they’d really appreciate a review but they don’t interrupt your workflow.

NEUTRAL: I wish Apple didn’t restrict putting specific apps on the Whitelist. That would have been a great boon if possible. That said, I’d imagine the developers are more frustrated about that than I am.

Amazing!!,5,2019-04-17 14:51:10,False,i just really like this app ok,"I truly love this app, it’s so useful in so many different ways. Like most, I definitely use it for productivity when doing work and forcing myself to stay off my phone. However, the biggest help I’ve seen from this app is turning it on at night before bed. I always struggle with aimlessly scrolling through social media while in bed, and I know it takes away precious sleep hours from me. I set the timer for 2 hours before bed so I am motivated to stay off my phone. Plus, I love collecting all the tree specifies and achievements. Such a simple yet effective app :).",
Tree growth,5,2022-08-05 00:15:18,False,Jdie.88,I’ve used this app for a few years now and I really love it. It does it’s job and keeps me focused. My only issue is I use this with the pomodoro method so I really only use the time for 25 minute intervals so my trees never develop all the way. If I get really focused sometimes I’ll go over. It’s nice that it still gives me coins if I go over time  but it would be even nicer if the tree continued to grow! Or if I use multiple of the same tree the trees grew the rest of the way. If you do the full 2 hours you get like 4 trees.,

Forest keeps me on task when I’m working, and makes me rediscover fun offline when I’m finished with work.

What I really love about working with Forest is that you don’t have to focus for hours on end. I keep my timer at 25 minutes, and the timer goes off just as my mind starts to wonder. I also really love that they provide a break timer right away, so then I can make sire I’m not on my phone for hours before I start working again. Also you help plant trees, so what’s not to love.",

I set a timer for how long I want to be productive, and for that whole time, I can’t use my phone without making my tree wither.

Love my trees but is it useful?,3,2019-12-16 17:02:18,False,Klurm,"There’s definitely a productive benefit to watching a tree grow and focusing on a specific task. That’s what this app does. So, for anyone who creates content, freelances, or is looking to build a skill, this is a SIMPLE way to monitor time and focus. 

But this is not a time management app. 

It’s barely a time tracker and more of a in-app store to buy digital trees. Maybe that’s all the app wants to be. And as someone who has a deep love for tamagotchis, Im into caring for a focus Forrest with different unlock-able trees. That’s totally my bag.  

My issue is that there’s no real analytics behind how you’re spending your time. I’d love to be able to see how my time is being used. That stats they do show you are pretty shallow. 

I know the app doesn’t promise to be a habit tracker, I just see the potential of it being one. I want similar stats to programs like Mint or Instagram analytics. I also wish the animation and actual Forrest function was more dynamic. 

In all it’s an okay app but I think it could become awesome.

Incredible and Effective,5,2019-02-07 17:52:57,False,HelloLovelies,"I’ve never written a review for an app before because no app has had such an extreme effect on my life. 

I was horribly addicted to Reddit. I was spending 5-6 hours scrolling my life away reading one forgettable post after another. I tried content blockers but addiction just made me delete them when I needed to mindlessly scroll. 

This app is different. The fact that it’s like a game where you can watch beautiful things grow and even make a real difference by planting a tree in the real forest is so motivating. Now when I start scrolling I plant a two hour tree so I can read, practice music, do yoga, or a multitude of other productive things. 

Thank you so much for creating a wonderful app! Looking forward to more trees and more updates in the future :) 

One suggestion. I think it’d be really cool if you could have a custom forest where you could pick and choose trees and bushes to decorate your own plot of land!",

To prevent this, I think there should be a solution. Something like a 10 second timer to return to the app when the break finishes to receive extra coins or maybe to save a mini tree from dying that was planted during the break.

Easy to understand, straight forward, but it would be great to make the various sounds offered from the app more attainable. I saved and got the beach sounds and it’s been great to study too. To reach the next audio sound will be weeks away and this is without any other spending allocated to trees. I get the idea of keeping coin value high but maybe varying the price of different items or reducing cost of audio tracks offered might allow for more wiggle room among users and create higher drive to use the app.",

Great way to encourage off time with your phone,5,2019-11-13 14:43:24,False,mommyauri,If you’re like me you spend too much time looking at your phone. Many hours of the day checking social media or email or texts. This gives a small reward for even short intervals where you simply put it down. Family dinner is a great one. And other times I find this useful for keeping me off the phone long enough to allow me to fall asleep. I wish coins weren’t so hard to come by and the prices didn’t constantly go up.

Not Awesome on iPad,3,2020-11-12 00:20:26,False,oblivious_wanderer,"As a time-tracking/management app, Forest is both easy to use and fun to engage with. That said, it’s clearly optimized for the iPhone. The iPad version doesn’t support landscape mode, which makes it rather awkward to use while working on an iPad. It’s a shame, since the increased real estate on a tablet offers a wealth of opportunity for, say, streamlining the information gathered by the app.

I also wish there were a pomodoro mode. Yes, I could try to kluge together a series of trees to approximate the pomodoro timer, but it’s a pain to figure out if it’s time for a long break and it’s too easy to remember not to start a break timer.","{'id': 19081113, 'body': 'Hi, thank you for your feedback.

It provides the structure and discipline I need to get my work done. I absolutely love the rainforest sounds, too. If you are thinking about getting this app - just do it.

Forest is Fun,5,2022-10-15 20:46:22,False,Moseyismetal,"As a neurodivergent ADHD type person I really like this app. I never write reviews but feel like this deserved one!

This app is really simple - it doesn’t try and do anything except create a timer for your work (ideally pomodoro style chunks of time but whatever floats your boat). You can set the app to not complete your study time (poms are 25 mins) if you leave the app! You can also turn that feature off easily. 

Other than the option to require you to stay in the Forest app and the time you study, it’s really simple. For each study session you complete you grow a little tree and get reward coins. 

The different things you can grow as you keep using it are actually really motivating but not interesting enough to be distracting. I have had a lot of pom timers but this is always the one I use.",
Great for focusing!!,5,2021-01-10 22:17:31,False,Deeiyengar,"It’s a great app. So proud to see my timeline with how much it accomplished in a day.

I look forward to the new plants that come out and I WISH they would do like a “Turtle Plant” for reptile lovers (don’t have a cat or dog). In case anyone is wondering: National Turtle Day is May 23 and are in dire need of conservation help.

1. If “taking a break” didn’t end the extra minutes you can get. As it is, the feature is useless because you may as well have just quit out of the app anyway.

2. If you could take one break during the original time you had allotted. This would be useful for long work periods and/or if you just needed to make a quick phone call or text.

3. Giving up should give you a dead tree and the alive trees you already earned. If you spend 60 minutes working, then have to end 5 minutes early for something, all your time working shouldn’t go to waste just because of that five minutes!

Love this app😍,5,2018-11-29 05:10:16,False,denvercjd,"Absolutely amazing app: great design and very pleasing to the eye, all kinds of fun plants, and makes it easy to be off your phone! I love that you can plant real trees with enough coins. Forest has many relaxing sounds to help you focus, but also lets you play music as long as you start playing it before planting a tree(at least this is what I found with Apple Music). Strongly recommend this app if you want to control your screen time in a fun way!",
I love it!,4,2019-04-10 20:06:12,False,brookethorn,"It definitely helps me to study and stay focused and also read. I like it a lot especially since you earn coins. The only thing I would like to see change is maybe a break button, like on the flora app they had a break button where you would hit it and can use your phone but it would subtract that time from your finished time. It gave you the option too if you wanted to be able to have breaks or no breaks. I would love to see this on this app.",

Great App - Odd Feature,4,2020-01-20 22:43:27,False,igorspet,"I think this app is great. It certainly provides a unique way to keep your focus. I love the fact that earning in-game coins allows a real tree to be planted somewhere. 

It does seem strange though that to buy a digital tree I have to use coins that could otherwise go to planting a real tree. It seems like there should be a different in-game currency system for digital tree purchases.

A few requests to improve the app:

   Allow users to modify the alerts when the timer ends.  Currently, when a timer ends the notifications are a little too subtle so it’s easy to go over your time.  If users can modify the alert notifications with a different tone or vibration sequence, that would make it much easier to allow yourself to focus on your work without having to worry about missing your intervals.

I know the app is suppose to get people away from their phone, but if it were more rewarding and engaging on the app itself, it would only increase the time the user uses the app per day as well as the amount of time the user stays enjoying using the app (before users get bored with the app and forget about it).","{'id': 11677560, 'body': 'Hi,\nThank you for all your suggestions.

Instead, they should have a timer running, counting how much time you spent looking away from your phone and rewarding from there.

Forest helps me ignore my phone. It’s such a seemingly simple psychological trick, but it works: pick up my phone, kill a tree. It doesn’t matter that it’s not a real tree. The app successfully games my mind into behaving as if it were.

I would love to see a less light-hearted approach taken with some of the unlockable tree types that caters more to mature audiences or those who enjoy realism in gaming.

allow the team to continue another plant task,5,2020-05-22 20:51:26,False,yushi_liu,"Hi forest developers, 

I am an addicted user and I love this apps very much. I urge you to propose a new function. That is to allow the team members to continue another plant task after the previous task is done. Currently, when the plan task is done, the team is disbanded. It’s very inconvenient to reorganize another team with previous team members if they were not the host’s friends. I strongly recommend you fixing this and allowing the host to commit another plant task with the last team members.

Thanks,

One of the best apps I’ve ever purchased,5,2020-06-11 17:54:14,False,IsaV602,"Here’s the truth: I’m only in middle school but this app has been a LIFESAVER. I’m a straight A student but still find myself procrastinating and not putting all my attention toward my schoolwork. Especially when I have an exam, I always wait till the last minute to study. Ever since getting this app though, I have found myself being more productive. This app allows me to set a goal for myself for when I would like to get something done in a period of time but still allows be to do it correctly. It makes you want to get your work done because you are building a forest while spending time towards your responsibilities. I have stopped looking at my phone every five seconds and have learned to detach from social media. This app has helped me pick up a good work ethic which is very much needed right now as I am having to start to prepare for high school.

If your anything like me, you have to have some sort of sound going on in the background. One specific thing I absolutely love about this app is it’s option to put on a sound while the timer is going. These sounds are soothing and don’t distract you. One sound for example, is just the background noise of a rainforest. I use this option all the time when doing homework or even just preparing for an exam. One thing I will have to say about this app is that your forest doesn’t grow very quickly. You have to be constantly using this app to fill up your forest and don’t get many plant options at first. But every time you grow a tree it’s very rewarding to see how your forest grows. Overall, I am so glad I stumbled upon this app and know I will continue to use this in the future. ( If your deciding whether or not to buy this app, I suggest you do. It’s well worth the two dollars. )",

Unfortunately, as mentioned in the App Store, we cannot detect which app the user is using because of the limitations of the iOS system, and therefore we are unable to implement the App Allow List feature on iOS. As a workaround, we've made Deep Focus Mode, which, when turned off, enables users to use the apps they need while planting. Let us know at support@forestapp.cc if you have any more questions.

Two important things I see.

First, you can’t use the phone as part of what your focusing on. This is likely okay on a phone, but Forest on the IPad makes no sense at all. I use iPads for working: reading and taking notes among other important activities.

Second, the Forest Watch app doesn’t install.

so good for focusing!,5,2019-03-19 02:22:15,False,sfp22,"let me just say that this is hands down the BEST app i have ever paid money for.  at first when i bought this app, last year, i wasn’t really in the right mindset to make the most of it.  i didn’t really use it and felt no motivation to use it.  but this year i decided i wanted to be more productive, and not waste time on my phone.  when the new school year started, i had a system: get home from school. eat a snack.  browse social media for 10-15 minutes MAX.  then i’d go to my room and open the forest app, and set it to 25 minutes.  for 25 minutes i do nothing but the task i have in front of me, no distractions, ringer off.  when the 25 minutes are up, i set the break timer to 2-5 minutes, depending on how hard the task was.  during this time i get some water or a snack, stretch, do a mini workout (pull-ups are a quick one), answer any texts, or go outside for some fresh air.  then when my timer is up, i get back to work and do another 25 minutes.  and i keep doing this until i’m about halfway through with all of my work for the day, and i take a 10 minute break to really process the information i took notes on or just take a break.  then i get back to work and repeat the 25 minutes of work, 2-5 minute break cycle.  this system has COMPLETELY changed how i get my work done.  instead of procrastinating and doing it all last minute, or doing 2-3 hours with no breaks, i do a decent amount of work with enough break time in between that i don’t get too exhausted.  one thing if you try to use this method or something similar—while you’re on the break in between work sessions, i recommend NOT going through social media.  answering texts is fine, but i find that for me if i look at social media it’s very hard to go back to work, and i ignore the “get back to work!” notifications.  even if you don’t use this exact system, or something similar, i recommend taking a few breaks because it really does help you understand what you are actually doing.  my grades have gone up a lot after i started using the app for homework, and i have much more free time to do fun things once i’m done with all my homework.  i highly recommend this app to anyone who has work or homework they have to do, and anyone who has a phone and struggles with putting it down and not getting distracted.  i’m sorry this is such a long review, it’s the only review i’ve ever written for anything.  i just felt that people should know how amazing this app is and how it can completely change your life!  also as a bonus when you complete your 25 minutes or whatever time you set, you get credits which you can use to get new types of trees, or if you want you can use them to plant real trees in real life!  

in conclusion. BUY THIS APP :)",

"Good app, helps me focus",5,2019-05-04 16:52:25,False,ejgjhbnn,"This is a good app. I have been using it since 2015 and I am pretty satisfied with it. The new tree/bush species are beautiful and having different species really does motivate me to keep planting my garden and to earn more coins so I can unlock a new species. I have huge issues with wasting time on my phone and time management due to executive function issues and mental illness and this app has helped me a lot as a college student. The app can’t force you to do your work, but it CAN force you to take a break from your phone, and that ten minute break can be really, really useful when you are stuck. I also love that you can input custom tags to  track and categorize different categories of planting time (sleeping, class time, homework time, etc) and that you can see your progress on the graph. The options to keep the screen on, track exceeded time, and ding or send a notification when the tree is done are also really helpful for me. My only suggestion would be to show us a better preview of what a tree will look like when planted for a shorter time before we pay coins to unlock it. For example, the preview image for the apple tree shows a big apple tree with apples and a picnic basket, but once you buy the tree you realize that you can’t get it to look that pretty unless you are able to plant it for a longer time, like 40 minutes+. If you are only planting trees for less time, like 30 minutes or less, then a lot of the trees look kind of the same and they are not as colorful or as big as pictured in the store, because they don’t “grow” to look like the picture. Overall I love your app and would absolutely recommend it to anyone who is struggling to break away from their phone. Thank you, Forest app developers! ❤️🌳",

So close to perfect!,4,2020-11-10 00:31:56,False,MorosaCrimson,"I’ve used Forest for about a year now, and I love it on my IPhone! Before using Forest, I would find myself using my phone while studying, which would lead me to losing focus and having to reread sections of text because of that lack of focus. When I got this app, however, I started studying much more effectively because the urge to use my phone was no longer there. I would highly recommend this app to anyone who is having difficulty with staying focused!

Now as to ways that Forest can improve the app: I recently bought the Apple Watch SE, and when I saw that forest was available for my watch, I knew I had to download it! When I opened it up, however, I was greatly disappointed. You can’t start a study session on your Watch, and the majority (if not all) of the features that make Forest for the IPhone great aren’t present. To me, it would make sense to add the ability to set a study session on your watch and have the countdown on it. After all, isn’t Forest meant to keep you off your phone? I could over look this, if it weren’t for the fact that you pay for this app. Other apps similar to Forest have the same features on the Watch app and their IPhone app. On top of the superior functionality, some of those apps also have the benefit of being free. 

So to sum up: this app is amazing if you’re using it on your IPhone, but where it can truly shine (in my opinion) is the Apple Watch. Forest is an amazing app, and I truly hope that the developers find a way to add more features to their Apple Watch app.",

Awesome App!!,5,2019-11-05 18:28:33,False,ForesterMom,"I have been using the Forest app for almost 2 months now and this app has been amazing!!! It has helped me be way more productive and create so many good habits!! I'm a mom with kids and it's often hard to get motivated to do housework, pay bills, etc., when the same chores stare me in the face day after day. Growing trees gives me just enough incentive to not only get things done but also I can then look back and realize at the end of the day I have actually accomplished something! Also, I have always struggled to maintain good habits such as exercise daily, eat a certain amount of fruits & veggies, get to bed on time, etc., but with this app I grow specific trees/bushes for each habit I maintain each day. I then have a record to not only help me remember to do each habit but to see how long I've maintained it. I know some reviewers mention it's ""just a timer"" but for me, it's the extra bit I need to motivate me especially as there is a record of my accomplishments. Also, I like that each tree/bush costs an additional 100 coins up to 1000 per tree/bush as early on that motivated me to add more things/habits I grew trees for, which then made it easier/quicker to earn enough coins for the next tree. Just be creative how you use the app!! Finally, and very importantly, I wanted to mention that I had no issues with the app until just the other day when an issue came up with trying to label the trees. I contacted the app makers through feedback under settings and they not only responded but had the bug fixed within 24 hours. For a couple dollars this app is so incredibly worth it!! Thank you!",

Secret weapon in war against ADD,5,2017-10-18 01:49:31,False,9174649392847473920100191,"Forest is a vital tool for me in school. I have been using the app for about 11 months now, and I can say it is completely worth the cost. As a college student who has had to work her way back from a 2.0 GPA to a Masters student, I can say that this app has contributed to my growing success academically. I used to get easily side-tracked by notifications on my phone or even just by scrolling through my camera roll to procrastinate. Now, I like logging hours and knowing exactly how much time per day and week I spend preparing for classes. Knowing I can't take a break until my tree is grown keeps my self control strong. Logging study hours gives me confidence before each lecture or test because I can operationally define how much studying is ""a lot of studying."" Additionally, I use this app as one of several weapons against symptoms of ADD. I used to justify distractions on my phone, telling myself I couldn't miss out when I got a snap chat or Instagram notification. This app has shown me that those social distractions snowballed into hour-long escapades online and kept me from completing basic academic tasks. I tell everyone who asks about this app that it is fantastic. I love that there are new changes, such as the background sounds and 10 second grace periods. Additionally, the opportunities for awards keep me coming back; since the start of fall term I've made it my goal to plant healthy trees thirty days in a row. My suggestion for this app would be to keep it simple no matter how many updates it goes through. Other apps such as Instagram and Snapchat (though they serve entirely different purposes) are receiving poor reviews because they added too many unnecessary features. As someone who gets distracted easily, I fully appreciate the simplicity of this app and its basic reward system. Please keep the app clean and simple! Thank you for this app!",

Great for Developing Study Habits,5,2021-09-13 23:25:01,False,msarmiento1,"Overall, this application is 5/5. The visuals and theme are beautifully done and cohesive throughout all aspects of the application. It is perfect for users seeking to break unhealthy habits so common with cell phone usage. It could be particularly useful to adolescents as their limbic system and prefrontal cortex develop at separate times creating the need to practice and develop executive functioning skills explicitly (Laser, J.A. & Nicotera, N, 2021). Using a rewards system, this application effectively promotes self-discipline and self-regulation. The positive reward of growing a successful tree or forest capitalizes on adolescents heightened sensitivity and desire for reward (Steinberg 2014). Instead of creating a punishment or negative consequence for the inability to stay focused and off other apps, Forest rewards time well spent. Users can choose what type of trees they want to plan and work towards earning coins to buy a bigger selection of trees and plants. This allows the user to really make their forest their own and become invested in it, therefore helping positive brain development.  

A huge benefit is the ability to train the user’s brain to focus for extended periods of time. By starting at ten minutes and with the ability to go to 120 minutes, the user can increase at their own pace the amount of time they can enter focus mode. Through varied rewards, the application encourages the practice and growth of self-discipline. The achievement badges for users who plant trees multiple days in a row and establish practice patterns really emphasize the importance of practice and repetition for positive brain development and self-regulation. The more the user practices self-regulation and self-control through the app, the easier it will become.",

Growing with Forest: Technology and Procrastination,5,2018-11-11 23:27:55,False,jnbordallo,"In a residential university setting, there are already so many distractions that I face. Most of my friends live just down the hall, social events occur every night, and activities in my dorm and clubs have become a part of my daily life. When I am finally able to escape this frenzy of socialization and sit down in the library, I confront the most tempting distraction of them all: my smartphone. I grew up in a generation of social media and personal technology, and in result, I have become somewhat dependent on the constant stream of information and entertainment available to me on my mobile device. From Twitter to Snapchat to Instagram, there are endless feeds to go through, videos to watch, and people to talk to. In the past, I have taken extreme measures in attempt to squelch my temptations toward the infinite scroll. I have turned off my phone, deleted applications, and logged out of accounts. Despite my efforts, I have always failed to honor my own restrictions, regardless of the fact that it is in my best interests. Because I had not found a solution to my tendency towards distraction, I decided to try ‘Forest,’ a focus-motivating iOS application for smartphones. Forest uses the symbol of a tree in order to motivate users to stop their phone use. When one uses Forest, one sets a timer on the app, and throughout the duration of the set time, a virtual tree grows. If one uses one’s phone as a timer is ongoing, the tree dies. In using Forest as a part of my student workflow, I found that its usability, aesthetic design, and conceptual design work well into my practice of study. Although I observed that the app helps me focus in times of high-intensity study, I will probably not use it in the future for relatively low-urgency schoolwork.",

Improved my career/grad school habits…and,3,2021-06-15 14:51:45,False,Olo Look Wo,"The 1st and only app that has effectively changed my life for the better. The support/accountability of being in the Discord/Facebook communities is great for planting trees that I don’t have (but that the room owner has), so I can focus on saving for planting Real Trees. But this review wouldn’t be helpful to the developers if I didn’t mention some possible improvements that would make it 5 stars: #1. The daily ranking for “Deep Focus” time has been counting the time when I disable “Deep Focus” mode too. Either the rankings should just say “Focus Mode Rankings”, or the rankings should only include time when “Deep Focus” is enabled. I recommend the latter option because I planted with “Deep Focus” disabled, then I closed the app, and scrolled through Instagram for over an hour, and still got coins/trees. I tested it again to make sure: I planted a tree, then I exited the forest app (closed it completely), opened up Instagram, waited for a minute, and when I reopened the forest app, the tree was still growing and the remaining time hadn’t even stopped counting down while the app was closed. It defeats the entire purpose of the app/rankings. #2. Add room invitations to the timeline. This would be so valuable. I’ve accidentally dismissed room invitations, and I know people sometimes wait 10+ minutes before starting to grow the plant so that people can find the link and join the room, but I can’t view my “recent invitations” or anything to join the room if I accidentally dismissed it. When that happens, it feels like I’ve really missed out, and I get discouraged. But if the invitation were in the timeline or even in a “Recent Invitations” section for 30 minutes, and it included a link to the room, I would almost definitely be able to join more foresters for growing sessions. #3. Add an optional “status” field to my profile for friends (or specific friends) to see. Also, the option to make the “tag” visible to friends would be great too. That way, my real life friends can check why I’m not responding to texts by checking my Forest status and would see that my planting status is “active” and the tag says “meditation”, so they know that I’m not just ignoring them. The option to make these things visible to friends would be a nice addition. #4 I would love it if my screen could rotate while the plant is growing. You allow the screen to stay on so I can see the plant grow periodically, but I like to lean my phone up against something so I can glance at it now and then…If my phone is charging, then it must be sideways for it to be leaned up against something (or else it will need to balance on the charger cable and that causes it to fall and become a distraction). If it rotated, then I could have it on it’s side, but still see the plant grow in the right direction because the screen orientation would have adapted to landscape. I’m only speaking from my experience, so I understand if these ideas don’t make it to production, but I think there are good reasons for them.
