Cptfunk,Probably my favorite app?,5,"I genuinely don‚Äôt even know if I had this regular of a sleep schedule when I was a kid. I have ADHD and would regularly spend until four in the morning researching whatever that week‚Äôs new interest was on my phone instead of sleeping. The novelty of getting new buildings, the frustration of a house collapsing, and the desire to keep consistent so I have the funds to configure new areas of my town are all strong enough to keep me from blowing it off, which is a pretty huge feat. Also, when I did hit a patch of not using it for awhile, I discovered the Circles function, and having friends build projects with me gave me the added element of public accountability. The only fundamental way this app could be better would be if you were somehow able to download it onto other devices and your desktop so that you can‚Äôt hop from your phone to somewhere else, but also, like, an app can‚Äôt actually be a full adult for you, so ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. (That said, developers, if you could give the option to edit the sleep goals for Circles groups every couple of weeks in case of slight schedule changes in the group, I would love you forever.) Anyway, it‚Äôs an incredible app, and my mental and physical health are measurably better for it.",2019-04-02 18:01:01,False,
Robotdjuret,Enabling Success,5,"Like the featured reviewer, I, too, have struggled with sleep regularity for my whole life owing to ADD. This has always been a problem for me. It‚Äôs caused tension in relationships and meant that I‚Äôve gone around on very little sleep a lot in my professional life. I have been using Forest for a couple years to measure my work and to combat distraction and I downloaded Sleeptown to see if it would have the same benefits. A month later, my sleep regularity is at +90% in Sleep Cycle (where it has never been in the 7 years I've been using that app) and I'm sleeping better, snoring less, and have worked my sleep debt down to almost nothing. I particularly enjoy the phone shaking challenge in the morning. And I can tell this app is going to change my life.

**A couple recommendations**: the art is good, but I would enjoy different styles a lot more (like futuristic or steam punk or medieval village‚Ä¶ especially a medieval village), and I wish it were 3D (or at least that I could rotate the town on its fixed isographic PoV). And it would be really fun if I could import my trees from Forest and be able to place them in my towns.",2021-08-02 06:59:13,False,"{'id': 24305609, 'body': ""Hi, thank you so much for your support and suggestions!

Mains bodkin,A bit too strict,3,"It‚Äôs a nice app but it‚Äôs so strict, if you miss by a couple minutes, even if you still get to bed in roughly the same time, the building will be destroyed. 
Another thing I don‚Äôt like is that once you missed my sleeping time that‚Äôs it, you failed the night and there‚Äôs nothing else you can do. But really, even if I missed my sleeping time by hours, it still helps to just click ‚Äúbuild‚Äù and put down the phone when I do decide to sleep. I want to use this app for helping me get away from my phone, and i still want to use this feature even if I did miss my sleeping time. But right now ‚Äúmissing you sleeping time‚Äù is just the end of the story.
I don‚Äôt even want to open this app after not being able to build a single house for three days. There‚Äôre tracking apps more forgiving rewarding and helpful than this one.

What I think might help is to add a period in which you want to go to bed, then a deadline by which you have to get off your phone. Say you want to sleep at 10pm, it may help to give you a period between 9:30 to 10:30 in which you can hit sleep and start building the house, but still allow you to have some flexibility, say I can still reply to a text at 10:05. But then by 10:30 is the hard deadline after which the house will be destroyed if you look at your phone again.",2018-12-05 11:03:56,False,"{'id': 6284495, 'body': 'Hello,\n\nThank you for your suggestion, we will take this into consideration. :)', 'modified': '2018-12-07T09:09:24Z'}"
xHALFRICANx,Surprisingly addictive (the good kind),5,"Alright so it‚Äôs not a game, nor will it require time away from anything. I was first brought onto SleepTown by way of Forest which has changed the way I use my iPhone for the better! SleepTown has not only surpassed my expectations but believe or not I am going to bed on time and not spending time on my iPhone (how simple that may sound I know there are millions of us who can‚Äôt due to the phone addiction) then waking up to a surprisingly building that provides me with a weird satisfaction that I slept and obtained a building for my town. Look, this is probably not for anyone who could give a rip about spending countless hours on their phones while in bed or could care less about sleep (if this is you... life catches up), but if you are in the class of ‚ÄúI care about the quality of sleep and want to break away from giving my attention to a device that is a time sucking, data hog, irrelevant piece of metal and plastic‚Äù... then I would suggest SleepTown.",2019-04-14 01:36:43,False,
allspice75,I want to like this app,3,"So there are definitely things about this app that I like! It‚Äôs very cute and a fun way to incentivize not being on your phone before bed. I have the sister app, Forest, for concentration and staying off my phone during the day and that one is perfect in my mind! But this one still needs some changes to be perfect in my mind. I‚Äôve seen a few other reviews suggest having a sleep time window and a wake up window so you don‚Äôt automatically fail if you‚Äôre off by 15 or 30 minutes, which I agree would be really nice. The strictness of destroying your building if you leave after you decide to go to sleep is effective and I think that should stay, but there definitely needs to be a 30 minute cushion between sleep time and wake up time. My only other complaint is the days off feature. I‚Äôve selected Saturday and Sunday as my days off since that‚Äôs when I get to stay up later and sleep in later, but I still get notifications on those days to go to bed in 30 minutes and missing those days still breaks my streak. I hope that some improvements can be made cause I really want to like this app!!

Stephiiiiiii,Wish there was more flexibility,3,"I‚Äôm really bad at staying on my phone when I‚Äôm in bed so an app like this is really helpful in helping build a habit. However, there are a few things that really make it hard for me to like this app. I really enjoy the ‚Äúgame‚Äù aspect of it and how it‚Äôs a challenge because it really incentivizes me, but it‚Äôs just not realistic to check-in when I go to bed every single time. For example, tonight I missed going to bed by 1 minute and that automatically constitutes as a failure. The problem with this is that now I don‚Äôt have an incentive to not be on my phone. I could just move my sleep time to 11pm, but that defeats the purpose of it. While ideally my sleep time is 10:30pm, it‚Äôs just not realistic for me to go to bed at exactly that time and sometimes it‚Äôs just a matter of forgetting to check in (even with the notification). I would like there to be an option for a ‚Äúsmaller‚Äù incentive if you miss your bedtime goal but still don‚Äôt want to use your phone at night. i.e. maybe it should count towards half a building or something similar.

Flflilil,I don‚Äôt scroll through social media for 3hrs anymore before bedtime!!,5,"I‚Äôm a pre-med student so sometimes I run on 4hrs of sleep. I have their forest app for productivity and I got this to change my sleep habits. Your actions are your consequences and I really love the idea of this app. If you‚Äôre into cute stuff like this while also getting your sleep in, you‚Äôll love it. This app has an alarm function to ensure you wake up and build your town. It gives you 10 mins after wake up time, or else your building will crumble. Also, you have to make sure you stay in the app in order for your building build while you sleep.

Super neat app, will definitely impact my sleeping schedule as I can spend hours scrolling through TikTok or Instagram üòÖ",2021-06-19 11:33:23,False,
Randomuser53728162,Great motivator,4,"I enjoy this app almost as much as I enjoy the Forest app. Really amazing how much not wanting to see a building destroyed can motivate me to go to bed and wake up on time. The only real downside is that I‚Äôve built pretty much all of the buildings, and I don‚Äôt really have that novelty factor anymore to look forward to‚Ä¶another minor thing: if any new designs for buildings are currently in development, I would request some buildings to have entrances that face southeast. Pretty much all the buildings right now have entrances that faces southwest, which make the towns that I design a bit limited in their orientation. Perhaps you could allow us to turn the buildings, like we can turn the other items (benches, tables, etc.) And finally, like the Forest app, it would be great to be able to have a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual view so that I can have a better sense of my progress; right now only the weekly view is available. Thank you for an amazing app and all your work!",2019-05-14 13:46:58,False,
PopMyBubble,Not lively enough,3,"It needs more motivation and determination, as well as consequences. Yes you will not end up with a built building; however, it is not like the app ‚Äúforest‚Äù created by the same developers. ‚ÄúForest‚Äù allows for productivity and its major use due to the consequence from disturbing the growing plant. If you do not complete the process, the plant will die and destroy the forest‚Äôs beauty. This dead plant is turned to ash and costs a lot of coins to get rid of. This gives a strong motivator in not breaking the process of the plant growth. 

What would make this sleep app affective is if it was more lively. For example, towns people going in the buildings. Transportation driving around. Building roads. Build a park for the townspeople to roam and play in. Build a beach or desert. There are multiple things that could be added to make this app a lot more fun and entertaining. It doesn't have to be something that requires a lot of time, but also have a bit more involvement.

LHB0911,Just doesn‚Äôt work,1,"I‚Äôve been trying to use this app for a week. First, the alarm never went off for the first five days. I emailed the developer but got no response. Then it finally did go off - on the day that was supposed to be ‚Äúoff‚Äù. So on Saturday I was woken up at 5:45am, finally figured how to turn it off (after waking everyone else up) and went back to sleep. When I did get up, it told me the building had failed. I‚Äôll live with the disappointment, but in terms of tracking habits through visuals, the app clearly doesn‚Äôt work. 

Since it requires me to be on my phone just before bedtime and right as I get up, creates any level of frustration in between (including nearly making me late for work), and doesn‚Äôt actually track any sleep habits whatsoever or with any degree of accuracy, I‚Äôm not sure this was worth spending the extra money on. It‚Äôs too bad, because I really like Forest, which has helped me be more productive at work.

JenelleGloria,Must... Gamify...

AriaRose7,Good app but...,4,"Forcing the user to go back into the app to keep progress is an amazing feature, but here is where SleepTown looses a star for me, the two hour waking up period before the alarm goes off and 15 minutes after wake up is to much, for me at least. I wish that there would be more customization with the time allowed before and after the set sleeping period. This app is totally worth the money though. I would love to see continuous updates, I also think they should add a feature where you can set a sleep goal and it adjust your schedule according to your starting sleep time and slowly adjust to reach your goal over a series of nights or whatever set time the user wants.

Composer123,Frustrating/fussy and negative,2,"On one hand I love the building aspect of this app-I've been using it about a month. On the other there are some fundamental design flaws that run for to good sleep hygiene; some of which would happen in any sleep promoting app and others which they could improve. 

It's never pleasant to wake up to ""you have failed"" if you oversleep.

The alarm does not adjust with any change you make to your target wake up time. 

The alarm itself is wonky, and doesn't always go off. 

The controls are fussy and there are far too many rules to do the simple task the app is supposed to do. 

You have to remember to push ""sleep"" every night before you go to sleep. I don't see a way around this but it's one more thing to think of when you're in bed. 

Finally, some creative mind will have to come up with an app that doesn't compel you to be on your phone. Screens are a big part of the reason many of us have bad sleep habits! Plus, it would be nice not to have to be on your phone when you wake up, too. As it stands you have to unlock your phone, go into the app, and activate it (and then collect your coins, so you're immediately playing a game right when you wake up). 

In short, too much fuss for a simple goal without a lot of incentive.",2017-12-27 13:08:06,False,"{'id': 2195411, 'body': 'Hello,\nWe thank you for the detailed suggestions. We have put them into consideration and we will keep on improving the app. Forest', 'modified': '2018-01-03T16:00:20Z'}"

My ideal bedtime would be 10:45. Before using the app, my bedtime was closer to 2:00 AM. I set 1:30 AM as a bedtime to have something to shoot for. So if I go to bed between 11:30 and 1:30 I can hit the ‚Äúsleep‚Äù button and be good. I slowly worked back to a better bedtime.
Now that I‚Äôm in the rhythm, there are nights where I want to go to bed at 11:00 PM but I have to wait extra time to hit the ‚Äúsleep‚Äù button. Counter-productive.

oddtrees57,Great app - needs some improvements,4,"I started using this app two weeks ago and it has really motivated me to try to keep a regular sleep schedule. I get so excited about seeing the new buildings the next morning and it motivates me to stay on track for the longer term incentives and more rare buildings. It‚Äôs exactly the kind of low stakes, positive incentive that feels motivating without building more pressure that is counter productive for sleeping. There are two ways this app could be improved:

1) I would LOVE if there was a setting that would allow you to leave the app for 5 min (or a limited time) without destroying your buildings. I often wake up in the middle of the night and use a meditation app to get back to sleep. If there was a way to leave the app for 5 min every hour or something without destroying the building that would allow me to turn on the meditation and return to the app. When I‚Äôve turned off strict mode altogether to use any app on my phone during sleep, I inevitably abuse it and am on my phone for hours. (I have ADD and it‚Äôs just too tempting!)

1) the design your own town feature has some bugs and is hard to use. I often get an error that my town is out of sync and I need to reload, and when I do I am no longer able to continue making some edits - like returning recently purchased items without losing my coins. The items will only face one or two directions, so it is hard to tell from the store if they will work for the place im hoping to use them for. I would love if they improved this or made it so that you can delete an item at any time and get your coins refunded.",2020-04-18 17:18:56,False,

tanabanana13,Not ideal for third shifters,4,"This app is unfortunately not for people like me. I‚Äôm a longtime user of the Forest app which has always been one of my favorites for when it comes to forcing myself to get things done, whether that‚Äôs studying or reading or napping without interruptions from my phone. Yes, I have used Forest for sleep in the past, which is why I thought this app would be a good one for me. Putting my phone away and getting to sleep has occasionally been an issue for me as I have a crazy third shift sleep pattern that causes me insomnia, as well as a very restless mind. I‚Äôm always going to sleep too late and waking up too early. When I wake up too early, I tend to play on my phone to ‚Äútire myself out,‚Äù but of course that only serves to wake me up even more. So I thought this application really does have the potential to be the answer to that. It has all the same motivational factors as Forest with build progress that I‚Äôm loathe to interrupt by using my phone in the middle of the night. It has a design that does not encourage you to wake up too early. Unless I‚Äôm understanding incorrectly, you pick your preferred bed time and wake time for the week (you can give yourself two days off, such as the weekend) and you must attempt to consistently go to sleep and also wake up within two hours of either goal. Cool, but I quickly found out that this functionality has its major drawbacks for a person with a fluid work schedule. Anyway, it‚Äôs easy to understand that an app like this is intended for the average person who is up during the day and sleeps during the night with a fairly regular routine who just needs some help promoting their sleep hygiene. I, on the other hand, work third shift, three random days a week, and my schedule is not set at all. So I am constantly having to change the sleep and wake goals, which resets my streak and is overall just a general pain to do on a nightly basis. I think the concept of the app is very good though, if I still had that kind of schedule. I‚Äôll admit that when I downloaded it, I was really just hoping for another version of Forest that was town-themed and specifically made for naps. I thought it would have a more whimsical and spontaneous option exactly like Forest‚Äôs format where you could decide on a whim that you wanted to build a house for a little catnap, pick the design, then go. Something you could use anytime you wanted. Not something that has to be so structured for people who do not have a structured schedule. But like I said, there is already an app for that, and it‚Äôs called Forest, so I may just go back to using Forest and setting my tree tags to ‚Äúsleep.‚Äù But because I think this app is quite good with just some room for more flexible features, I believe it deserves 4 stars!

Sschwachter,Beautiful and Functional,5,"Gameplay

Although it's not listed as such, sleep town is a game. Every night you go to bed on time and wake up on time you're given a reward. While this app isn't the first to do this it's definitely the best I've seen, I go to bed every night on time so I can see what beautiful building I'm going to wake up to in the morning. I find myself estatic rising in the morning and seeing what type of building I've created. This app once made my day because I awoke to the sight of a completed fairground. Not to mention in the new 2.0 version I'm absolutely compelled to get up on time so I can have a few minutes to spend my coins and edit my town. The ability to create my own town let's me live out my dreams of city planning. The addition of achievements I think was an amazing way to introduce new decorations. I hope to see more in the future.

My only gripe with Sleep Town's current system is that each block is created by a 3x3 grid with (most) housing and decorations taking up 1 square. I think a block should be a 9x9 area and while (most) housing should take up a 3x3 chunk, decorations should take a 1x1 area all the way to a 3x3 with additional opportunities for more complex shapes such as a fountain stretching 3x9. It would also be nice to be able to turn buildings (they look a little goofy all bunched up facing the same direction.) but I can respect that would require completely redrawing all the artistic assets from another angle. Which brings me to the next section.

Artwork

This app has some of the best artwork I've ever seen. Now admittedly I'm a little biased on this point, the artwork has a sort of minimalist feel to it that I have found I love. Seeing the beautiful and often complex architecture and design of the buildings has filled me with such immense satisfaction that if this app was simply a way for me to view this artwork for 99 cents I would have still bought it. By combining simple geometric shapes and familiar ideas of constructions I find myself drawn to admiring what would appear to be a rather mediocre medium income house. Then occasionaly I'll stumble upon a house I'd  assume to be owned by a millionaire and gawk mindlessly for a solid 60 seconds. 

U.I.

Sleep Town's user interface leaves a little lacking. While I do like the simple five buttons at the top of screen I feel like the settings are a huge mess. It needs a rehaul desperately. Perhaps a more spaced out section with subcategories that drop down so it doesn't look so cluttered?

Conclusion

Overall I think Sleep Town is a fantastic way to burn a dollar. I think it'd currently underrated and deserves a lot more attention than what it currently has. I hope to see it become more frequently used in the future and look forward to further updates. I can't currently give a 4.5 so I figure why not round up?

John_Chris,Great app!! Helped me to sleep and rise early!!,5,"Rome wasn't built in a day! It was built at night! üòâ So is this app!
If you just download it without actually using or paying due attention to it, like I was initially, then you won't benefit from it. 
Once start using the app and keeps building those cute little houses üè°, it's difficult to give up your hard earned progress! Your cute little house will be ruined üèö just for leaving the app for a few seconds. So, no phone-play in bed before sleep!!
Another great thing is that you can only earn coins to unlock new buildings for your small town; you can't buy coins with real money. That's GREAT!! Frankly speaking, I'm certain that I'd spend some real money (if allowed) to remove unfinished buildings and unlock new houses. But the developer won't allow it! He or she will only let you earn it by sleeping on time!! That ethic is awesome! üëè  
Keep up with the EXCELLENT work!!",2017-05-26 16:25:42,False,

Shalimart,Finally! Healthy Sleeping Habits,5,"I'm sold.  This really works.  I've been using the app for 21 days straight. I've gone to bed on time, and gotten 8 hours of sleep for 3 straight weeks!  I know this sounds like an exaggeration, but this is life changing for me.  I've had the bad habit, for years, of staying up late working.  I would press snooze on the built in bedtime alarm on iOS.  The fact that I would break my building streak has kept me going.  I'm waking up early and getting work done, with clear head and a cup of coffee.  Having to shake your phone vigorously guarantees that you wake up.    Much thanks to the developer.",2017-05-26 11:41:12,False,
Mae4,Lovely app,4,"This is a really nice app. It looks beautiful and the interface is simple. It helps give you a reason to put your phone down and go to sleep when you need to.

My only gripe is that you lose all your progress with consecutive days if you redo your sleep and wake up times. If you have a consistent schedule I can see it being really nice, but when I'm switching from day shifts to night shifts I have to adjust my sleep and wake up times and I find it works best for me to do a small change each day. For me, it would be more useful if the consecutive days was based on how many days I slept for a goal number of hours. Perhaps some way to switch whether your goal is to go to bed at a consistent time or to get a certain amount of sleep? I still really enjoy this app and will keep using it, I just wish that my progress wouldn't restart because of a schedule change!",2017-05-16 22:11:03,False,
AnonaLlama98,Good sleep app,4,"I had previously been using forest to enforce my bedtime, so when I saw that the developer had released an app explicitly for that purpose, I was thrilled. Overall, I am quite happy, however there are a couple of shortcomings that the developer needs to address to take this app from ""good"" to ""great""

First, the bedtime notification is  not persistent enough. Users should be able to set the app to remind them more than once before bedtime. Two nights in the first week I used Sleep Town, I dismissed the 15 minute notification so I could finish up work, the got distracted and didn't open the app in time.

This brings me to my second point: it would be nice if there were a way to still use the app to enforce sleep even if you've missed bedtime. Perhaps one could plant trees/hedges that don't produce revenue, but still prettify the city? I could just use forest for this, but it's nice to have an all-in one app (and forest doesn't let me have those longer times).

In addition to these main problems, I also have some minor UI quibbles (I wish you could view the city in portrait mode), but other than that, this is a very good app, and would definitely get five stars if the issues discussed above were fixed.",2017-09-03 04:15:30,False,
rockeke,Much needed,5,I am a major culprit of using my phone before bed which keeps me up later than I intend on being- this is a good concept and I loved your other app Forest that I just had to get this one. Simple- not to mention the shake in the morning is a good way to wake someone up!,2017-05-10 02:23:40,False,
Leviathan,Define: Shake,2,"What a lousy user experience. First morning waking up with the app. I was all excited to complete my building, but no matter what I did, I couldn't gain any progress on the shake meter. So my building failed.

Developers, before you respond to me with information about changing the shake difficulty level, you need to realize that doesn't matter. The word shake is pretty clear, but you somehow built an app that didn't know what shaking means. Because when I tested the ""easy"" level after my building failed, I saw that no shaking was required.

The truth is, you failed me in your design, which created a poor first experience with the app. I'm no longer interested and will be asking for a refund.",2017-05-13 09:57:07,False,"{'id': 321431, 'body': 'Sorry for the unpleasant experience. We will improve this in the future version. Thanks for your feedback. :)', 'modified': '2017-05-14T02:19:21Z'}"
the good kush,Good idea but...,3,"It just didn't work for me. You couldn't change the wake up and go to sleep times, and it just don't motivate me really. It makes me said that I actually had to pay (which is the only thing keeping me from deleting it) and it would be a lot cooler if it were free. I feel like paying is a contract that I can't ever get out of üòÇ I'm rating three stars instead of one because because it had a good idea (that needs work.) and the fact that maybe it works better for other people.",2017-06-29 03:41:08,False,
Stryken101,App Suggestion,3,"Quickie Review:
I gave this app 3 stars because it is a good idea that has allot of room to grow. It is a bedtime helper (helps you put down the phone) that uses incentives to help you achieve your sleep goal. For this reason, the app works and is useful.

Constructive Crictism:
Personally, my life has a crazy schedule. My job does not allow me to have a consistent sleep schedule as in midnight to 8a every day. I would be very nice if the developers could allow you to change the time on the fly with penalizing you. Suppose allow for a duration in the day where changes are allowed. In addition, the developers could add some sort of week schedule that we could program each week. Both would be nice. 

There are some smoothness issues but for bow the above implementation would be much appreciated.",2017-09-07 03:13:29,False,
run2tunes,Nagging,1,"App has potential to motivate user to go to bed and get up on time, but has some major problems. 

1. Constant nag screens demanding user sign up on for web account. Sorry no. For people who might be willing to set up a web account there needs to be some explanation of the benefits. If the developer insists on retaining these nag screens, they should be used much more sparingly.  

2. Developer chose to force users to turn their devices to predetermined orientation for each view rather than allow user to choose orientation. Being forced to turn one's device repeatedly while using an app grates. It is a good example of why most apps don't manage orientation this way.

Please fix this. I love your other app, forest, because it helps me a lot. 

Also it would be nice to add different times for each night before you go to sleep. Or at least allow us to make a weekly schedule (that is easily adjustable, not going into the settings and other menus to switch it).

Ellerooful,I love this app!,5,"I am already a die-hard user of this developer's Forest productivity app...and SleepTown is equally great! As someone who has trouble trading distractions for a good night's rest, this app has proven very useful. I usually avoid destroying a structure at all costs, even when I'm having trouble sleeping and the temptation of my phone is particularly strong. Ultimately, the motivation that this app provides helps me fall asleep faster and wake up more refreshed.

WORD OF ADVICE TO NEW USERS: before going to sleep with this app on the first night, be sure to set the shake setting to ""easy."" You must shake VERY vigorously on the harder settings, which causes frequent failure and destroyed buildings. I'm not very strong, but I've never had trouble with the easy setting.

One suggestion for the developer might be to introduce more things to spend coins on. I don't want to bulldoze my destroyed buildings, since they are a record of nights that I didn't sleep as well...but as far as I can tell, bulldozing is the only option for spending the coins we collect. Maybe options to purchase relaxing sleep sounds or new bedtime/wake-up alarm sounds (kind of like the sounds available for ""purchase"" in Forest)? Or options to use coins to donate to charity (as in Forest)...or purchase new types of buildings or building features (also in Forest...can you tell I like Forest?). This app is new, and new features show up in Forest all the time, so I'm sure something is in the works... In any case, keep up the great work! Your apps have improved my quality of life in more ways than one!",2017-05-30 23:04:21,False,

Cricketry,Alarm doesn‚Äôt work all the time,3,"Nice concept but the alarm sometimes doesn‚Äôt go off and I miss the goal and end up with an ugly destroyed building that takes 100 coins to get rid of?? It wasn‚Äôt my fault‚Ä¶ also I woke up a mere 10 min after the goal given my Apple (actually reliable) alarm went off‚Ä¶ and the building was destroyed. It‚Äôs too strict. There should be a setting where the alarm goes off all the time. Other times if I missed the bedtime I still want the alarm. Also it‚Äôs SUPER discouraging rather than encouraging to get a damaged building that won‚Äôt go away unless you get 100 coins... I actually want to delete this app now b/c I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be able to get 100 coins‚Ä¶ :( They should clear up after you go on a streak.

I‚Äôm not even sure why it didn‚Äôt go off this time! I set the ringer high enough for the Apple alarm to go off. When I checked this app‚Äôs alarm the in-app volume was up as well. The only volume that was down was the one for non-ringer sounds (eg. YouTube videos) and it would be ridiculous if the alarm was dependent on the YouTube volume sound! Even if it were it‚Äôd be better to say it in app :(((

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll keep this app with such heavy punishment and strictness while not being able to wake me up. I just really like the default alarm tune but it just makes me angry that I can‚Äôt wake up to it even if I set it properly.",2019-07-16 15:58:22,False,"{'id': 9867093, 'body': 'Hello, we\'re sorry for the unpleasant experience. The volume of the in-app alarm can be adjusted by enabling the alarm in the Settings page and then tapping the ""Alarm clock"" option which will take you to the ""Alarm settings."" Sometimes the alarm will not work due to system limitations, though our team is trying our best to overcome this issue. We suggest that you keep your phone charged while sleeping, as this may be able to improve the situation. It is also advisable to set your device\'s alarm clock, in case the alarm fails. In regard to destroyed buildings, they have to be removed with coins because otherwise users probably wouldn\'t care to miss their goal. We\'re sorry if it brings any inconvenience to you. If the in-app alarm doesn\'t go off and leads to a collapsed building, please contact us via the in-app feedback system, and we\'ll look into the issue for you. Thank you and we apologize for any troubles you\'ve encountered. - SleepTown', 'modified': '2019-07-26T17:43:47Z'}"

revngeofrobo,Great way to wake up!!,5,"Had a really hard time waking up, and have all my life (especially in high school and early college) I‚Äôm now a senior and figured it‚Äôs time to get my life in order. Bought a mechanical alarm clock and this app. Pairs perfectly for a heavy sleeper! I love how the app forces you to go to bed at a certain time. Adds a lot more certainly to my life and helps me with my goal of 8 hrs of sleep. Now when I wake up, I immediately have something to do (touch my phone and make a building) instead of going back to bed! I then use the app ‚Äú7 minutes work out‚Äù to get going at 4:30 AM. Both apps came recommended from Thomas Francis on YouTube.",2018-09-14 08:52:00,False,
